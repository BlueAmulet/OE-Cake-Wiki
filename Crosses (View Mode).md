**Crosses** is a View Mode in OE-Cake in which particles are displayed as crosses.![Jet reacting with mochi on crosses.](/images/Crosses.png "Jet reacting with mochi on crosses.") It is much more visible than [Points](/Points.md) and doesn't cost much in performance.

Crosses is the only view mode that can see particle rotation.

The Crosses and Points viewing modes are both good at viewing changes in density, such as compressed Elastic or pressure waves.
