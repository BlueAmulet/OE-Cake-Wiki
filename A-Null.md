**A-Null** is a material in [OE-Cake](/OE-Cake.md "OE-Cake"). Like [Snow](/Snow.md "Snow") and [N-Null](/N-Null.md "N-Null"), it can only be accessed by pressing a key and cannot be selected from the menu. In the case of A-Null, it is bound to the "A" key, hence its name.

## Description

Unlike [N-Null](/N-Null.md "N-Null"), A-Null is persistent, and unlike the [extraneous nulls](/Extraneous%20Nulls.md "Extraneous Nulls"), it is mutable and has some unique properties.

Any particle containing A-Null will be drawn lighter than other particles. [Water](/Water.md "Water") uses this effect to draw the lighter-colored surface. Surface water has the recipe QA, while the rest of the water is just Q, giving the surface a lighter color.

When combined with [Snow](/Snow.md "Snow"), the behavior of the material is changed drastically. AY behaves like a normal fluid, but sticks to other particles like paint.
