Bucket fills any enclosed space with the selected [material](/Materials.md "Materials").

You can change the density of the fill by changing *standardDistance* in the [Parameters](http://oecake.wikia.com/wiki/Parameters).

Changing the density also changes the range of the "splash effect" from the bucket. Setting *standardDistance* to a larger number, such as 5, makes it much easier to change or delete very dispersed particles.

The Bucket tool does not change the order in which the particles were placed, leaving their "hierarchy" identical to before. This is useful in "Shader" view modes, since it allows you to change the color of a group of particles without causing them to change their visual layering and altering the appearance of a shape.
