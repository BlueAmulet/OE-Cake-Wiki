An **Object**, for terminology's sake, is a large scale system in it's entirety, rather than a certain piece of it. So if you built a car in OE-Cake, the entire car would be an object, because you wouldn't say "Oh, I was hit by a fender!" you would say "Oh! I was hit by that car!", But if a wheel fell off and rolled over something, there would now be two objects, the car and the wheel.Â
