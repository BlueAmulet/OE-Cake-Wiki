![A picture demonstrating the effect in-game.](/images/Jetless%20travel.jpg "fig:A picture demonstrating the effect in-game.")![A diagram of the Baker Drive](/images/Rdrive.jpg "fig:A diagram of the Baker Drive")The Baker Drive is a type of reactionless drive in OE-Cake. The Inflow created propells the craft as if it were a regular inflow engine, but the outflow block removes all of the inflow particles.

How to make:

-   Create a rectangle of Rigid as seen in the picture
-   Delete a rectangle near the end, doesn't need to be very large
-   Use the Replace tool to Replace one side with RIG (rigid inflow gas) and the opposite side with RO (rigid outflow)

Why is it so special?

-   No particles come out of the engine, no exhaust = no lag
-   It is completely self contained
-   Can reach any maxSpeed set in the [Parameters](http://oecake.wikia.com/wiki/Parameters), but still keeps a high level of stability, more stable than [Jet](/Jet.md "Jet")
-   Not very powerful, best used without Gravity (Unless [Gas](/Gas.md "Gas") is added to make it resist gravity)
