**Fire** is a special animation only visible on [Blob (View Mode)](/Blob%20%28View%20Mode%29.md "Blob (View Mode)"). Fire particles are produced by any material containing Fuel + Hot or Jet + Hot.

The density of the fire, it's bouyancy, and how long each particle lasts can be changed in the [Parameters](/Parameters.md "Parameters").

For some examples of what can be done by changing the Fire settings, see this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/oeCake/comments/42iaic/exclusive_stills_from_an_upcoming_experiment/). To see the images click the link at the top of the page.
