[Powder](/Powder.md "Powder") and [Elastic](/Elastic.md "Elastic") are two materials that, when combined, turn into something that starts to vibrate heavily. Powder [Brittle](/Brittle.md "Brittle") Elastic shatters compeletely on impact, like a kind of glass. Powder [Inflow](/Inflow.md "Inflow") Elastic explodes in mid-fall.

This effect probably comes from the fact that Powder has damping in it.
