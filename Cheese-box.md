#### **Cheese-box**

A cheese box is a RM (rigid mochi) box filled with IJ (inflow jet). It got its name from the yellow liquid that shoots out of the box.

#### **Explanation**

The reason a cheese-box is so volatile is because jet and mochi give each other a incredible amount of energy. In fact the IJ or cheese gets enough energy from the mochi to fly through the walls of the box, and the box gets enough energy to float mid-air.
