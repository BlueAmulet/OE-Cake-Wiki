This page contains techniques that aid the process of creating advanced simulations by modifying or fixing a save file.

  

### <u>General Techniques</u>

These are the tools you will need to produce more advanced content.  
====[Parameters](/Parameters.md "Parameters")====
Modifying the Parameters is critical for creating advanced creations. There are many hidden settings and the many settings allow very diverse simulations.

  

#### [Ballast](/Ballast.md "Ballast")

Ballast particles are extra particles placed intentionally to slow down a simulation, allowing small and difficult to observe reactions to be seen more easily, and for manipulation of the Parameters on a finer in-game timescale. If the Drain mode is not enabled, it is easy to simply use the Bucket tool to fill the entire screen with Wall, then Move the particles off-screen where they won't affect the simulation. Setting *standardDistance* relatively low in the Parameters (around 0.2) will cram more particles into a small area, allowing shapes of Wall to be very compact.

  

#### [Selecting Particles](/Copy%20and%20Paste.md "Copy and Paste")

It is somewhat difficult to determine precisely which particles need to be moved from one save to another. See the linked Copy and Paste article in the header for a discussion about techniques related to copying and pasting particles across saves.

  

#### [Changing Particles](/.oec%20File.md#Editing ".oec File")

Since the file is simply plain text, it is very easy to manipulate with external programs. There are a multitude of programs that can perform all kinds of operations upon a file, due to it's repeated and orderly pattern.

  

#### [Robert's Comb](/Spin-Charged%20Elastic.md#Robert.27s_Comb "Spin-Charged Elastic")

Robert's Comb is a powerful technique which is capable of repairing Spin-Charged Elastic, as well as performing other operations on groups of particles.

  
===<u>Un-breaking a Save</u>===
Save files break somewhat easily while probing the game's limitations, essentially any deviation from the save file format will cause loading to fail. Many such failures are somewhat easily recoverable, since all of your hard work is still present and safe in the file, but the issue lies with how the game interprets one of the lines. All glitched saves fail due to errors on a single line in the file, as long as you DO NOT save the file again in-game the issue can often be resolved with a minimum of damage, restoring function.

The precise manner of the result produced by loading a glitched file can often provide clues to the nature of the error - the game loads content starting at the top and proceeds in an orderly fashion to the bottom before beginning the simulation. When an error is encountered, the game will put into play *all content preceding the error*. If you are very familiar with how your save is arranged, it can be easy to determine exactly where the error occurs. For example if very few, almost no particles are loaded, it means the error is very high in the list, near the beginning. Very high errors are most commonly caused by in-game glitches in particles such as [Nova Viscous](/.oec%20File.md#Infinite_Velocity_Bug ".oec File"). If it seems like almost all content is loaded, but there are patches missing and custom Parameters are ignored, it means the error is very low in the list, near the bottom. Mid and lower glitches are usually the result of user error such as a botched copy and paste, incorrect values for Parameters, or fat fingers hitting keys accidentally, leaving unexpected characters in random places.

Depending on the precise behavior of the game, subtle errors can be diagnosed down to a single Parameter, though Parameter glitches are always the result of user error so should be easy to narrow down. One way to determine if a save is actually glitched and not truly ruined in another manner (such as saving after loading a glitched save, which makes the glitch permanent), is to set *pauseFlag* to 1 in the afflicted save. The default behavior of the game is to begin unpaused and running, so if enabling *pauseFlag* fails to make the save load as paused, then it is glitched and needs diagnosis.

If all else fails to find the error easily, there is an efficient technique that can be used to most quickly determine the exact line which is causing the error. One can perform, for lack of a better term, what is essentially a [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) upon the save file. This is the fastest and simplest technique to find the exact line which is causing the error in a large save. Make a copy of the save first so any work done to it will not ruin your work, and ensure *pauseFlag* is set to 1. Start in the middle of the file, and delete everything in the first half except the header. Save the file and open it - if the game starts paused, this has narrowed the error down to being in the top half of the file. If the game starts unpaused, our error lies in the second half. If one has kept the save file open in a text editor, it is easy to simply hit Ctrl + Z to undo the deletion and return the content allowing the next step. Assuming the error is in the lower half, split the lower half of the file in two and delete half of that, a quarter of the save. If the save starts up as paused with that quarter missing, the error lies among the deleted particles. If it starts as unpaused and glitched, the error lies in the remainder particles. In this manner one can continuously subdivide the save into smaller and smaller segments, fairly quickly narrowing down the range of particles that must be searched, often to the point one can simply glance and scroll across the afflicted range and perhaps spot whatever error is present. Such as a botched copy paste job with two particles on one line. The subdividing procedure is aided by a text editor that displays line numbers, and can be repeated until there are only two particles remaining to sample. The offending particle can either be deleted or repaired which will clear the error and permit the save to load normally.

#### Group Index Repairs

It is possible to paste intact Rigid/textured creations from one save to another, however the process is extremely tedious and requires manual labor to make it successful. The problem is that both saves will have their group indices numbered as they are alone, the only structures in their save. When you move one structure to another (or try to copy/paste content with textures) all the content will think it is supposed to be number 1. If you just paste one Rigid/textured creation to another save and open it, components from one creation to another will link together corresponding to their group index, binding parts together essentially randomly (in order of construction/modification).

The way around this is to *increment* all of the group indices from save B, by the total number of particle groups in save A. You need to look through save A to find the highest group index, either manually or with a regex program. For low particle counts this is trivial, when structures become increasingly large is when it becomes more difficult. Finding an exact number is usually not critical however, as long as save B is incremented by an amount \*larger\* than the largest group index in save A, the game will automatically fill in the gap of unused indices. This is adequate as long as there is sufficient space left for padding, one must find the correct increment value with increasing precision as one approaches the maximum number of allowed groups.

One must ensure the pasted content from save B never has a group index higher than hex value ff (decimal: 256), the value will be truncated to 4 bits linking components in a overflow wraparound manner. It is severely difficult to determine which content belongs to what save, so it is recommended to perform a [temporal quicksave](/Copy%20and%20Paste.md#Temporal "Copy and Paste"). This provides a "key" particle which can be easily searched for, effectively splitting the file into parts making it easy to determine which particles belong to what creation.

  

#### Joint Index

In much the same manner as the rigid body group index, all joints have a "joint index" that they use to differentiate which crew they swing with. The first number in the joint is it's index, picked randomly. The maximum joint index value has not yet been determined, but it's readily apparent that it is much higher than the rigid body limit. When copying and pasting joint data from one save to another, two things need to be fixed - firstly the joint indices must be modified if any match between saves, and secondly the "target particles" in the joint must be realigned which is not a trivial task. The joint index is usually easy since the numbers are picked randomly by the game and very large, it is rare for them to end up the same between saves, and there is plenty of space to just add 1 to any overlapping numbers immediately differentiating them. However the target particle repairs are much more tedious and involve a tremendous amount of bojangling to fix (a regex program may help in this regard) so it is generally recommended to not copy and paste joints at all, and if one does be sure to have a stiff glass of Scotch at the ready.
