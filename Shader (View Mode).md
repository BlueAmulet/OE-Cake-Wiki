**Shader** is a view mode in OE-Cake that allows liquids to be translucent and gives objects a shadow as if light was coming from the top right of the playing field.![Shader mode, note the translucent liquid.](/images/VMshader.png "Shader mode, note the translucent liquid.") It is the most processor-intensive rendering mode, but also the most detailed, and is therefore the most commonly used alongside Blob. It also allows textures (i.e. pictures made of a certain element).
