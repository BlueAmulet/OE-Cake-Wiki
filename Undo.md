**Undo** is a tool in OE-cake that lets you undo the last action you did. By using a tool with the [Delete](/Delete.md "Delete") element to delete blank space, you can create a "quicksave" before running a long simulation.

Dragging something, disabling gravity, and pausing cannot be undone. You can undo the [Clear](/Clear.md "Clear") operation and un-resize windows by *immediately clicking undo*. If you click Clear or resize the window, then click the [canvas](/canvas.md "canvas") you will not be able to undo.
