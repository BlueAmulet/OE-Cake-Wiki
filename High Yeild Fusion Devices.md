In my exprience, the standard RIP and RIF fusion combos have nowhere near created the type of blast that I crave. The kind that lag the h\*ck out of your computer. Well, I have the answer. Enter the following mix code into Mix mode: IFMKJ, surrond it in RJP, then create a pocket on the outside with RJ, and lastly, place in the pocket HJL. Resume the game. If it was done right, it should look something like this:
<img src="/images/Caphghghture.PNG" title="fig:Caphghghture.PNG" width="356" height="356" alt="Caphghghture.PNG" />
(if it is not full, gently shake the inflow particles until full)

To activate, have the game unpaused, and activate gravity. Watch as your screen is filled with fire and your computer has an actual anurism.

Enjoy.
