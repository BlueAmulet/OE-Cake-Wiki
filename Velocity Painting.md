**Velocity Painting** is another new graphic technique at OE-Cake's disposal. It is a [Blurstreaming](/Blurstreaming.md "Blurstreaming") technique that takes advantage of the [Illuminated Gas](/Illuminated%20Gas.md "Illuminated Gas") material to allow permanent drawings to be made using a physical material in the game. Painting is actually very simple - fill your screen with the Illuminated Gas material but \*do not unpause!\* While the game is paused you will be able to right-click and drag on the screen to paint lines. This is caused by OE-Cake updating particle velocity while the game is paused, for some funny reason. So we can throw particles around while the game is paused and they gain all this speed and their tails get very long, but they can't move anywhere because the game is paused. The faster you move the mouse, the longer the tails and the more they overlap and the brighter the line looks. The "bleeding" and "shadowing" is caused by polarization - the lines are drawn in a certain direction relative to where your mouse moved, they have a "forwards" and "backwards" direction. There not that many particles in this sim, so when lines overlap, they "steal" tails and brightness from eachother which causes the shadowing as brightness is lost from the old line.
