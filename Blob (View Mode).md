**Blob** is a View Mode in OE-Cake; the first mode that does not show individual particles, rather it treats material as 'blobs', hence the name.![Blob mode, note the translucent gas particles and the fire effects.](/images/VMblob.png "Blob mode, note the translucent gas particles and the fire effects.") It also shows extra effects for Fire and Gas-based materials. It is the most commonly used mode alongside Shader.

Blob and Texture is the same as Blob but allows pictures (textures) to be visible.
