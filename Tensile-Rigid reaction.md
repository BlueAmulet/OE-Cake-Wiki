The **[Tensile](/Tensile.md "Tensile")-[Rigid](/Rigid.md "Rigid") reaction** is made by mixing the materials Rigid, Tensile, and optionally Gas.

Blocks of **RT**will "magnetically" stick to each other. Shapes made of RT will self-rotate in either direction. Exactly why is not completely understood, though it probably has something to do with the "sorting" algorithm Tensile uses to rearrange particles into a surface.

This effect is partly responsible for the strange behavior of [Baker-Bertrand particles](/Baker-Bertrand%20particle.md "Baker-Bertrand particle"). The reaction can be used to partially counteract Rigid's rotational damping and permit more accurate rotation.
