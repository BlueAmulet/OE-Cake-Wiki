A **nanomachine** is a mechanism built at extremely small scales, with individual parts only being comprised of a few particles each. Most, if not all particles in a nanomachine are necessary for its function.

[Elastic](/Elastic.md "Elastic") is very useful for constructing nanomachines, due to there being no limit to individual bodies (unlike [Rigid](/Rigid.md "Rigid")), the user having fine control over the position of the particles, its compliant nature, its stiffness at small scales, and several other interactions such as spaced EH.

## Single-use nanomachines

A single-use nanomachine is one that can only be used once. Single-use nanomachines often contain heat or outflow-based mechanisms, for example EH being used to release tension and perform an action.

## Resettable nanomachines

Resettable nanomachines can be reset after being used, and then be used again. Resettable nanomachines are more difficult to design.

## Applications

Nanomachines may be a means to create [artificial life](/Advanced%20Simulations.md "Advanced Simulations").
