**Supercriticality** is a phenomenon exhibited by fluids under very high [pressures](/Pressure.md "Pressure"). A fluid exhibiting supercriticality is called "supercritical", and one that does not is called "subcritical". The pressure at which a fluid passes from subcritical to supercritical is called the "critical point".

A supercritical fluid is defined as one capable of indefinitely supporting the [Gage reaction](/Gage%20Reaction.md "Gage Reaction").

Supercriticality is caused by extra energy generated through [teleportation](/teleportation.md "teleportation").

## Gage Reaction

Supercriticality and the [Sonic Boom](/Sonic%20Boom.md "Sonic Boom") reaction are closely intertwined. The continuous sonic boom reaction exhibited by supercritical fluids is known as the [Gage reaction](/Gage%20Reaction.md "Gage Reaction").

### Quasi-critical fluids

Some fluids are past the critical point but do not exhibit the Gage reaction. The fluid is supercritical as it is capable of sustaining the reaction indefinitely, but to make a distinction from supercritical fluids that do exhibit the reaction, they are called "quasi-critical". This state is [metastable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability) and the reaction will occur if the fluid is agitated. The amount of force needed to start the reaction depends on the existing pressure.

Most materials have different behaviors under pressure but [Tensile](/Tensile.md "Tensile") and [Powder](/Powder.md "Powder") stand out. Powder does not exhibit a Sonic Boom like most fluids, but instead begins vibrating intensely. It is highly compressible before particles become energetic enough to begin [Teleportation](/Teleportation.md "Teleportation"). Tensile has an unusual behavior of radiating particles from a blob if it is too large. This is because the surface pressure of the blob is so great the particles in the center become compressed to the quasi-critical level by a self-sustaining feedback loop. When the particles are compressed sufficiently, there will be an almost microscopic sonic boom between as few as two particles. This pop will spread the particles apart to a subcritical density and the catapulted particles usually get caught by the rest of the family, quelling the reaction. This causes the blob to vibrate as the particles oscillate around the critical pressure. If the blob is too large, the amount of force can generate a sonic boom with sufficient energy to teleport particles either completely out of the blob, or so fast that they surpass surface tension and exit.

### Pseudocritical fluids

A sonic boom can occur even if the total pressure is under the critical point. This "false" Gage reaction in a subcritical fluid may persist for some time but will eventually fizzle out.

  

### Breakdown/Critical Pressure

Critical pressure is an amount of pressure past which point a fluid is considered supercritical.

Breakdown is the process in which a fluid begins exhibiting the Gage reaction. A quasi-critical fluid collapsing into a supercritical fluid exhibiting the reaction is referred to as "breaking down". At this point the waves of pressure have reached all particles, energizing them past the threshold. It is no longer possible for the particles to settle unless conditions change.

Breakdown pressure is above critical pressure and is the point at which a quasi-critical fluid can no longer exist.

## Hypercriticality

### Degeneracy

Under extremely high pressure, the behavior of particles resembles normal fluid behavior less and less. This is referred to as "degeneracy", and occurs in two distinct phases. As pressure rises past the critical point, the reaction transitions from what resembles a wave bouncing around the fluid to something present throughout the whole body of fluid. Visually, it appears "spongy" at this point. As pressure approaches the hypercritical point, this texture becomes smoother. Right before the hypercriticality point, the density of the fluid is mostly uniform.

### Quantum Effects

When the **hypercritical point** is passed, a fluid begins exhibiting [quantum effects](/Quantum%20Physics.md "Quantum Physics"), the most notable of which is a [vertical wave-like shifting pattern in density](/Condensates.md "Condensates").

## Uses

As the reaction is incredibly hard to contain, the uses of supercritical fluids are limited. Most often, they will be created spontaneously to create some energy, but then quickly become subcritical, as in an explosion or [some kind of engine or reactor](/Advanced%20Simulations.md "Advanced Simulations").

Supercritical fluids, if contained, are much more powerful than subcritical fluids. See [supercritical hydraulics](/Supercritical%20Hydraulics.md "Supercritical Hydraulics") for methods of containing, moving, and performing work using supercritical fluids.

OE-Cake does not follow the laws of thermodynamics, so supercritical fluids can be used to create infinite energy. They exhibit perpetual motion by definition.

## Inhibition

Supercriticality often causes problems due to it being fairly easy to cause and extremely difficult to contain. The function of [high pressure devices](/Hydraulic%20Pressure.md "Hydraulic Pressure") could be impeded by supercriticality, as building up too much pressure could cause an explosion and break the device.

### Prevention

Supercriticality can be prevented in a few ways. The most obvious is to make sure that fluids never pass the critical point, but this is difficult for large scale constructs working with powerful forces.

[Parameter editing](/Parameters.md "Parameters") may be useful for preventing supercriticality.

### Containment

[J](/Jet.md "Jet")[W](/Wall.md "Wall") is used in subcritical hydraulics, but at normal density it cannot contain supercritical fluids. However, it's possible to create very high-density walls dense enough to contain supercritical fluids. These can be created through [parameters editing](/Parameters.md "Parameters"), [save file manipulation](/.oec%20File.md ".oec File"), or by using the [bucket](/bucket.md "bucket") tool on a very dense (far past the criticality point) fluid.

A density gradient may also be useful, with the wall being less dense the closer you get to the inside, to make sure that if any fluid breaches the wall that it will end up back in the tank before it can escape.

Currently, all methods for reliably containing supercritical fluids are hypothetical and have not been sufficiently tested.
