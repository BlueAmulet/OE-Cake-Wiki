If you want to make your own "patched" exe, follow these steps:

![An example setup for RunAsDate](/images/RunAsTime%20example.png "An example setup for RunAsDate")

1\. Download the **32-bit version** (not 64-bit) of [RunAsDate](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/run_as_date.html)

2\. Move OE-Cake *and it's important .dll files (everything that came in the original .ZIP)* to the location you would like to keep it (such as C:/Program Files/), if you haven't already

3\. Start the RunAsDate program, and chose OE-Cake as the program to use

4\. Set the date to any time before November 5th 2008

5\. Uncheck "move forward according to real time" and check "immediate mode", and type in the name of your now-patched EXE

6\. Click "Create Desktop Shortcut", and use the new shortcut to run OE-CAKE in future

## This application is from an unidentified developer (OSX)

The latest versions of OSX try to protect you from malicious software by only letting you open programs from known developers. There's nothing wrong with OE-Cake other than it's age, so the way to get around this limitation:

1\. Right-click on OE-Cake

2\. Click "Open"

3\. It will ask you for a password to allow OE-Cake to always run

4\. Enjoy!
