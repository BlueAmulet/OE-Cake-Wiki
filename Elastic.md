**Elastic** is a yellow, stretchy material that tries to return to it's original shape. It acts a bit like Jello. It can be melted by Hot. Elastic experiences a linear distortion - the harder you stretch it, the harder it tries to return to shape. Viscous + Elastic creates a tougher, less jelly-like material that closely resembles rubber.

### Uses

Elastic is one of the most important and useful materials in the game. It can be used to store power and deliver it smoothly. *elasticCoefficient* determines how gooey and stretchy Elastic is, while *elasticIteration* changes how stiff or sloppy it is.

Elastic has 6 known states:
