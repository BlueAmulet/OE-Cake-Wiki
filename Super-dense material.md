Super-dense material is really strange and miraculious stuff, it may be a form of particle [entanglement](/entanglement.md "entanglement"). It can be created by detonating a pure mochi bomb, waiting fore a while, and replacing the flowing mochi with any solid element. This results in particles packed so tightly together, that calculations become painfuly slow. As an example of a screen full of super-dense mochi vs regular mochi respectively

The Super-dense mochi is clearly compact and the normal mochi is almost invisible (the first image kinda looks like a dessert.)

Anyway, there are many useful applications for SD material, the most obvious is of course, pressure ressistant piping, this was covered by another post, but SD is far more powerful. Unfortunatly, it does not work well with large machines, due to lag and small margin for error. Another, less intuiative use, is causing lag to improve platforming or to see mundane reactions in slow-motion. Also, be sure your scale settings aren't too high, which could cause a crash. And save, ALWAYS SAVE.
