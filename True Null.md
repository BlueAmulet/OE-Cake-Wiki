**True Null** is a type of particle in [OE-Cake](/OE-Cake.md "OE-Cake").

## Description

Understanding True Null requires some knowledge of how OE-Cake works:

Every particle has a recipe, which is essentially a list of "true" or "false" values to "does this particle contain this element"? For example, [Elastic](/Elastic.md "Elastic") particles are particles that contain the element [Elastic](/Elastic.md "Elastic"). True Null is a particle that does not contain any elements. It is not an element that can be used in normal gameplay, and is better defined as what's left when you remove all elements from a particle.

## Uses

Null is useful as it is a fluid that doesn't have any unique properties whatsoever. Its mechanical properties can be used without it having any kind of chemical reaction with another material.
