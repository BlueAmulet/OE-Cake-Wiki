Null Theory is a [theory](/Theoretical%20Physics.md "Theoretical Physics") that attempts to describe the behavior of [Null](/Null.md "Null") particles.

## Types of Null

Null Theory divides "null" into four types of materials:

-   [A-Null](/A-Null.md "A-Null"), a fairly straightforward material responsible for the surface effects of water and the behavior of AY,
-   [True Null](/True%20Null.md "True Null"), which is less a material and more the absence of a material,
-   [N-Null](/N-Null.md "N-Null"), an elusive material closely related to True Null,
-   and [Extraneous Nulls](/Extraneous%20Nulls.md "Extraneous Nulls"), 6 identical materials that are unintentional and can only be created through save file manipulation.

### A-Null

[A-Null](/A-Null.md "A-Null") is by far the most "normal" type of null. A-Null is essentially a normal material like any other, only being inaccessible via the materials panel. It is heavily associated with [water](/water.md "water"), and all of its known properties can be observed through water.

A-Null is colored lighter than other elements, like [Inflow](/Inflow%20%28Element%29.md "Inflow (Element)"). This effect is used to create the surface effect of water, as water is Q, but the surface water is QA. The A component is added or removed depending on whether or not the water is exposed to air.

A-Null also has an interaction with [Snow](/Snow.md "Snow") in that AY is a normal fluid except for the fact that it sticks to objects, acting like some sort of paint. This is due to the fact that Snow is supposed to be QY, which means the surface water effect applies to it. This results in slightly different physics between Y and QY.

There may be more interactions based on A-Null, but we have not yet discovered them.

### True Null

[True Null](/True%20Null.md "True Null") is essentially a particle with no materials. If you think of a particle as containing a bucket, and each bucket containing the materials that determine its behavior, then True Null is an empty bucket.

True Null has no interactions with any particles other than Outflow. It can be absorbed by all forms of outflow, as it has no components that could block outflow from eating it.

### N-Null

[N-Null](/N-Null.md "N-Null") is a material, but it has very strange properties. N-Null will automatically remove itself from a particle, causing pure N-Null to revert to True Null. This means that it likely isn't useful, but it's still possible that some use for it might pop up someday.

### Extraneous Nulls

The [Extraneous Nulls](/Extraneous%20Nulls.md "Extraneous Nulls") are 6 materials that appear after [Eraser](/Eraser.md "Eraser"). The extraneous nulls are effectively the only materials in the game with no special properties. They are immutable, and the only impact they have on the game is through [Inflow](/Inflow%20%28Element%29.md "Inflow (Element)") and [Outflow](/Outflow%20%28Element%29.md "Outflow (Element)"). Mixing an Extraneous Null with Outflow causes that Outflow to ignore any material that contains the same Extraneous Null, which is useful for filtering particles. Inflow and an Extraneous Null will create particles that are immutable to an equivalent Outflow, making these particles safe.

They are named after the first six letters in the Greek alphabet - Null Alpha, Null Beta, Null Gamma, Null Delta, Null Epsilon, and Null Zeta. However, they are completely interchangeable - swapping out all Null Alpha for Null Gamma will have no effect on particle physics.

Extraneous nulls were only discovered very recently, and there is still much to learn about them.
