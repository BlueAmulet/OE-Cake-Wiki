![Stable Elastic matrix of particles separated by more than a particle's width](/images/Sparse%20elastic.png "Stable Elastic matrix of particles separated by more than a particle's width")Sparse Elastic is a form of [Elastic](/Elastic.md "Elastic") usually produced through [save-file manipulation](/.oec%20File.md ".oec File"). It is possible to create a variant of it by manipulating Parameters to drive the particles apart, though I can't remember how right off.

## Uses

Sparse Elastic has interesting chemical properties such as an extremely high surface area and the ability to deform relative to reactions occurring within it's volume, which can help monitor and visualize forces.

Sparse Elastic also has mechanical uses, in particular for creating springs with a lower computational cost (ie. better FPS) than a typical high-density spring.

Sparse Elastic also has the advantage of being able to get configured on a per-particle basis, which would allow severely advanced creations to be made with enough inspiration and patience.

Sparse Elastic allows the particles to travel a longer distance without interacting, allowing purely elastic interactions with no effects from particle contact.
