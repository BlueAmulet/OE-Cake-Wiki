The ''fusion bomb'' is a more advanced type of composite bomb. This is the design that has been used to create the most powerful of OE-Cake's nuclear bombs, and has several attractive advantages.

### Building a Fusion Bomb

Create a shape (circle or square, doesn't matter) of the material RIP. Cover or Replace the outside of this shape with Rigid Powder, or Rigid Fuel, that way the Rigid + Inflow + Powder doesn't start Inflow-ing particles everywhere. You should now have a stable block of Rigid + Inflow + Powder that you can throw around without it Inflow-ing any particles anywhere. Inside this block you can place your explosive material. A common one is Fuel + Inflow.

### Usage

The bomb can be set off by setting the outside of the bomb on fire. As the outside of the bomb burns, it eventually contacts the RIP casing. The RIP casing explodes, compressing the Fuel + Inflow charge in the center, igniting the material and causing a chain reaction which makes it go nova.

### Tweaking

The most likely problem that produces a weak bomb is not enough RIP. The biggest advantage of a fusion bomb is that it can cause some of the more difficult materials to go nova. Bombs can be made of Viscous + Inflow, Snow + Inflow, two stable materials. Â
