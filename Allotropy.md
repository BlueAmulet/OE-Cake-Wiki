**Allotropy** describes the same [material](/material.md "material") being arranged in different ways that grant it different properties. Different arrangements are individually called **allotropes**. The pattern or structure of the particles is called a **lattice**. An allotrope of a material can be defined as particles

[Elastic](/Elastic.md "Elastic") exhibits the largest number of allotropes of any element discovered yet. Allotropy is also exhibited by [Rigid](/Rigid.md "Rigid"), [Wall](/Wall.md "Wall"), to a lesser extent [String](/String.md "String"), and all recipes using these materials.

Allotropy can be compared to the different structures that bodies of fluid assume within a [pressure](/pressure.md "pressure") gradient.

## Common Allotropes

All solid materials are arranged in a **square lattice** by default. Other allotropes are obtained through various means, such as the [Bucket](/Bucket.md "Bucket") tool or [save file manipulation](/.oec%20File.md ".oec File").

  

### Bucket Allotropes

**Bucket allotropes** are simple allotropes obtained by using the [Bucket](/Bucket.md "Bucket") or [Replace](/Replace.md "Replace") tool to turn a fluid into a solid.

Common lattice structures obtained through this method are **triangular lattice**, **honeycomb lattice**, or **amorphous** (no clear structure).

Using the bucket tool on [Tensile](/Tensile.md "Tensile") blobs allows creation of circular formations with concentric rings. For larger blobs, the material TV can hold itself together better than pure T. The resulting formation is a triangular lattice structure surrounded by a few tight concentric rings.

  

### Artificial Allotropes

Artificial allotropes are allotropes created by more refined methods such as save file manipulation.

  

### Material Allotropes

All fluids form various organizations and patterns of particles. String forms orthogonal allotropes naturally. Snow and Powder naturally settle into orthorhombic patterns after tumbling.

The material SPY self-organizes into a rhombic structure when disturbed.  

## Grains

Many lattice structures have a regular, repeating pattern. The default square lattice is perfect and uniform throughout, but this ceases to be the case with structures made by other means. There will likely be regions with the same overall structure but in different orientations, forming boundaries and irregularities in the structure. This phenomenon is observed in [real world crystalline substances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallite). A structure with this property is called **polycrystalline**. The individual crystals or regions are called **crystallites** or **grains**.

A distinction is made between polycrystalline structures and amorphous structures; the latter is defined by a complete lack of crystal structure.

## Elastic Allotropes

Of all materials, [Elastic](/Elastic.md "Elastic") is the most extreme example of allotropy due to its unique properties regarding deformation. [Brittle](/Brittle.md "Brittle") (BE), by extension, also shares many of these characteristics, with different allotropes breaking apart in different ways.

## Allotropy and Fuel

While allotropes don't affect the physical properties of [Rigid](/Rigid.md "Rigid") much outside of its density, it does have a noticeable effect on the way [Fuel](/Fuel.md "Fuel") (FR) burns.
