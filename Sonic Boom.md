A **Sonic Boom** is a reaction that occurs in fluids when they are compressed very hard, typically by Rigid.

It is a form of temporary, localized [Gage reaction](/Gage%20Reaction.md "Gage Reaction"). As a particular manifestation of [Teleportation](/Teleportation.md "Teleportation") in fluids, it is explained through [quantum effects](/Quantum%20Physics.md "Quantum Physics").

It is so named because it is analogous to a sonic boom in real life - in the game, any material travelling faster than the speed of sound in Gas will exhibit a boiling, almost exploding effect on the leading edge. Most commonly seen using Rigid, it is caused whenever particles travel faster through the volume of Gas than they are able to move out of the way.

As the particle [pressure](/pressure.md "pressure") becomes too high, forces within the particles keeping them separate begin to approach infinity. This causes particles to start moving more than half a particle's length in a single frame, allowing them to sit atop one another, creating an infinite repulsive force. This catapults two particles apart at a velocity determined by *maxSpeed* in the [Parameters](/Parameters.md "Parameters"). In a cascading reaction, more and more particles begin to add a tremendous amount of energy to the simulation disproportionate to the originating force. Gradually damping and other computational losses will cause the fluid to settle if it is not above the critical density.

It may be possible to produce vehicles or other devices that can harness this source of infinite energy.
