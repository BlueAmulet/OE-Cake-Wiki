**Canvas** is the given name of the (by default) grey work area of OE-cake, all things involving creation happen here.

The Canvas represents the real-time experience produced by the [particles](/Material.md "Material") and [parameters](/parameters.md "parameters") configured by the user and can be different than the state of the simulation preserved in the save file.
