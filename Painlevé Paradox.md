The **Painlevé Paradox** is a glitch common to many simple emergent physics engines, of which OE-Cake is a good example. The effect is caused by OE-Cake's form of [quantum physics](/Quantum%20Physics.md "Quantum Physics").

Basically the problem is, in real-life the dynamics between two sliding bodies are extraordinarily complex, friction is not easily quantified and simulated. At the microscopic level, tiny imperfections create a non-smooth surface and molecular forces result in random bits interfering, bumping and sliding past eachother. Even things that seem fully rigid are actually bendy and elastic at a microscopic scale, which allows their sliding forces to be distributed more evenly producing a constant level of friction given the weight and surface area.

This intense level of detail is well out of the scope of real-time physics simulation with current computing, so we often just simplify things down as much as possible - weight, surface area, friction coefficient. However this is not enough information to fully recreate realistic movement with how current physics engines are designed - in the case of OE-Cake and many others, objects calculate momentum based on their mass and how far they move per frame or per physics step, plus interference with other objects. This means it is occasionally possible for a particle or object to move far enough in a single frame to be inside another particle or object, causing a disproportionately large reaction force to displace it. The simulation can be realistic for slow speeds but loses considerable accuracy at higher speeds.

Observe the embedded GIF - it is nothing but a smooth Rigid rod sliding down a smooth section of Wall, realistically it should just slide straight down with no issue. However as you can see, the Rigid rod appears to hop and skip the entire way down despite there being nothing to get caught on. This is Painlevé's Paradox in action, why do two smooth objects not produce smooth motion? This problem is partly caused by the "resolution" of the simulation - the Rigid rod only has maybe 10 particles, so the radius of the particles of both the Rigid and the Wall are more significant and cause some roughness. However the Paradox rears its head at any size and is equally prevalent when a larger-scale simulation with a greater particle count is run.
