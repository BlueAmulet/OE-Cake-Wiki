**Pouring** is a function in [OE-Cake](/OE-Cake.md "OE-Cake"), in which a [material](/material.md "material") is created in the top of the screen. Wall will be removed and Rigid particles will not stick, the material becomes a liquid. Elastic and String will retain most of their connections, however. The function is activated by using (shift) + the material's letter, usually the first letter of their name. Then, the corresponding element will shoot out from the top of the screen. Example: type J for liquid jet, O for liquid outflow, R for liquid rigid, etc. This also works with Caps Lock.

As long as there is no User on the screen, the left/right arrow keys will adjust the pour position and the up/down keys will adjust pouring volume.

By modifying the *pouringMaterial* [Parameter](/Parameters.md "Parameters") in a save file, it is possible to Pour arbitrary recipes.

Pour becomes rain when backslash is pressed (/)
