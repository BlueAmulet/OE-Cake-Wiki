**Cool Heat** (Also known as IcyHot) is a material with code CHW. It is unusual (and quite useful in levels), in that it condenses [steam](/steam.md "steam"), melts [elastic](/elastic.md "elastic") and ignites [fuel](/fuel.md "fuel"), but doesn't make [water](/water.md "water") evaporate!

Something similar to the CoolHeat effect can be used to produce a [pressure sensor](/Pressure%20Sensor.md "Pressure Sensor").
