**Rigid Axis** is like [Wall](/Wall.md "Wall"), but it rotates around its center-point. It is often used to make a hammer or other rotating device by putting Jet inside one end of it. This makes it spin wildly.

Uses

Axis can exist in a liquid state, either by pressing Shift+X to pour some, or by mixing it with Inflow. Liquid Axis does not seem to have any special properties.

The material **XOR** is useful for cutting [perfect circles](/Circles%20%28Crafting%29.md "Circles (Crafting)") out of a section of Wall.

Axis can be moved around when mixed with [User](/User.md "User"). Axis only seems to work with Rigid.
