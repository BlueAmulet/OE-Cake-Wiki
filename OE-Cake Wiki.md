Welcome to the main page of this wiki!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When editing this page, please note a few things:

-   The inexperienced may want to check out the "How to help" section on the "community portal" article linked on the sidebar.
-   Remember this page is the most public face of the wiki - test edits are best done on a separate page.
-   Sections within "\<! --" and "-- >" markers (without the spaces) - like this entire section - are hidden comments, and can be separated by several lines. Be sure not to break them.
-   We strongly recommend you do not change the <mainpage-rightcolumn-start /> style tags - these keep your page format safe from unexpected breaks - the right column is first, followed by the left column. See <http://help.wikia.com/wiki/Help:Main_page_column_tags> for more info.

Please note that Wikia protection policy advises against the protection of this page unless it is the active target of vandalism.

-   Protecting the main page can do more harm than good, for example by preventing links being added.
-   See <http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Protection> for more info.

*OE-Cake! is a stochastic, two-dimensional physics sandbox that was a companion to the PowderToy and Algodoo (you may remember it as Phun), back when physics games used to be popular.*

*OE-Cake was one of the first physics sandboxes that could have solids, liquids, and gasses all interacting together, in real-time on your screen. OE-Cake can do water, fire, explosions, weight, friction, and pressure to name a few, and you can combine materials to create something completely unique. OE-Cake has some reasonably advanced physics and graphics options, especially for a game that is almost 10 years old.*

I need some help! [How do I...](/How%20do%20I.md "How do I...")

If you really want to help out, post OE-Cake videos on Youtube and talk about it on social networking sites, so that OE-Cake doesn't become lost! How many people will even read this? I hope enough that we find at least a few willing to contribute to the wiki, OE-Cake has so much to find.

Also, in an effort to discover how busy the OE-Cake community is, we have decided to implement a human-counter to determine what percentage of the page views are caused by people, and what percentage is caused by other internet beings such as bots, scrapers, crawlers, indexers, and who knows what else.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit from 2020: The world has seen many losses this year and 2020's misfortune didn't pass this wiki by.

Since about 2016 our user interaction poll collected votes from nearly 1000 users who saw this site, however when Fandom migrated the wiki to the new platform it appears to have wiped the survey from existence.
----  
<poll>
Did you read this title?
Yes
I'm gonna be sarcastic and hit No
</poll>You're fully capable of downloading the game and using the Wiki to learn how to make cool stuff. Get to it.

If you have an idea of something unique that can be done in OE-Cake, or know of a feature that does not have a page, feel free to be the first person to talk about it by creating a new page.
