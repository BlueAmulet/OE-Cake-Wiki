This page is considered outdated but has been left untouched because many people put a lot of effort into it. Please do not take it too seriously. There are only so many useful combinations of [elements](/Material.md "Material") and most of the ones on this page do not add anything to the game.

Focus on engineering with the basic materials, not chemistry.
----**Recipes** are combinations for use in [Mix Mode](/Mix%20Mode.md "Mix Mode"). Listed here will be these combinations, listed by their base.

To make experimenting with recipes easier there is the [Recipe Helper](/Recipe%20Helper.md "Recipe Helper") application for Windows. Using the Recipe Helper is recommended, as if you do not know what you are doing when editing this page you can quite easily wreck the layout/formatting!

To add a new recipe, use the {{[Recipe](/Template_Recipe.md "Template:Recipe")}} template. The first parameter is the Recipe code , the second is the material properties. For example:

`{{Recipe|TEST|MaterialÂ Properties}}`

(Note: Oh my god,some people just can't read.)

**Please Note**: Some people don't understand CLOSING TAGS. They should not be allowed to edit Wiki's. I fixed this page for you (it was horribly messed up) YOU'RE WELCOME.

**To the person that wrote the above note:**You probably did a great job but it has been messed up again.

**To all the people reading this wiki:**Don\`t bother reading anymore it has been destroyed by other people :( Very disappointing

**The {{Recipe}} template is now obsolete!** It uses the normal wikitable format now, meaning it can be edited in the visual editor and is much cleaner and easier to modify.

We are now putting work into revamping this page. If you are reading this notice, you can help.

A new set of standards has been established as an ultimate goal we hope to reach for this page. These are as follows:

-   For a recipe to be included on this list, it must meet the following criteria:
    -   It must have some function either unique to itself that cannot be accomplished by any standard material, or it must perform an existing function better than any standard material.
    -   If it is just being included for spectacle (i.e. it looks cool but doesn't do much), it must be unique in how it acts.
    -   It should not be a slight modification of an existing recipe without significant change in function. Such variants can be listed in the description of the simplest version of the recipe.
-   Recipes consisting of a word or phrase just typed into the game should be removed without hesitation unless they are useful.
    -   This does not mean mnemonics aren't allowed - if the recipe happens to resemble a word, it should be listed that way, in fact. It's easier to remember. For example, see RIP or SUSHI.
        -   This does not apply to vulgarity, which should always be removed.
-   Avoid overusing materials with too simple of functions. For example, [Outflow](/Outflow%20%28Element%29.md "Outflow (Element)") is quite overused at the time this was written, and there really are only so many ways you can make "thing that deletes stuff" interesting.
-   Keep recipes as simple as possible. Repeated elements cancel each other out and should not be listed, and elements that have no effect on the recipe (for example [Null](/Null.md "Null") in most recipes, [Elastic](/Elastic.md "Elastic") or [String](/String.md "String") in [Rigid](/Rigid.md "Rigid"), [Heater](/Heater.md "Heater") or [Cooler](/Cooler.md "Cooler") being present for no apparent reason) should not be included.
    -   While an exception should be made for mnemonics (for example "SUSHI" contains two S's, but it's easier to remember than UHI), they should not be listed in the "recipe code" section and should be put in the description.

If you feel like these standards are unsatisfactory in some way, feel free to propose a change to them.

At the moment, we're using [Recipes (Clean)](/Recipes%20%28Clean%29.md "Recipes (Clean)") to help the cleanup. This page is being built from scratch with a very different format, and when this page has been fully revamped, we will merge the two together, adopting the new format and putting it here. This is the final goal of this effort.

If you see a recipe here that should be kept, add "KEEP" to the end of its description. As lots of recipes are going to be removed, this should help us keep the good ones.

Thank you for reading this.

The page was previously organized by material, but that structure has proven impossible to maintain during the cleanup process. Until the cleanup is complete, the article will be one massive list.

| YABRVICFQ                  | This is an unusual blue solid that spawns a heavy blue gas. When the solid is touched by fire, it will start to spout a blue liquid from where the fire touched. The liquid has the unusual property that allows fire to touch it, and the fire turns dark as it does when it is put with water, and continue to burn for a VERYÂ long time. The same for the gas, put it near fire and it spawns said blue liquid (but in smaller amounts). |
