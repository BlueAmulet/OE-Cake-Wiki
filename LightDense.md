**LightDense** is a special material in OE-Cake that can be taken advantage of to make more advanced creations. As the name implies, it is a mix of [Light](/Light.md "Light") + [Dense](/Dense.md "Dense"), but it is not equal to another neutral liquid like [Water](/Water.md "Water"). The default Light + Dense neutralize each other's effect, causing the liquid to be neutrally buoyant and mix with Water evenly.

However if you change the [Parameters](/Parameters.md "Parameters") *upCoefficient* and *downCoefficient* you can cause something different to happen. LightDense is only neutral when *up* and *down* are equal to each other. If *up* and *down* are made slightly different, they no longer completely neutralize and the material LightDense will have a slight tendency to move in one direction.

This allows 4 levels of density when mixing: Light, Water \<-> LD, Dense, depending on what you set the Parameters to, instead of the usual 3: Light, Water, Dense.
