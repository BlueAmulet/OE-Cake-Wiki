**Illuminated Gas** is a special form of gas that is physically identical to normal Gas, but has some major visual differences. It is possible to see much more about the pressure and flow of Gas than normal, by changing a few settings. By making Gas extra transparent and setting a dark background, the extra particle trails generated by moving particles adds to the brightness of the material, making speed and flow more visible.

1.  Convert the Gas particles using the [Ghost Particles](/Ghost%20Particles.md "Ghost Particles") technique. A quick overcap:
    1.  Fill the screen with Gas
    2.  Save the file somewhere
    3.  Open it with a text editor
    4.  Find + replace all "b2 " with something like "16 " The spaces are important because there could be many places in the file that have a "b2" but the extra space ensures we only get the "b2 "'s at the end of a particle, because they would have a space after the 8 characters.
    5.  save and re-open in OE-Cake!
2.  Turn on Blurred Circles view mode. That's it! Combined, these two techniques work to "light up" the dark Gas from the inside, but only when it's doing something.

### Complications

Illuminated Gas isn't perfect, like most things in OE-Cake you need to carefully pay attention to how each variable interacts and know when to change a certain one by a tiny bit. Static Pressure is almost mandatory for simulating high detail in Gas. TimeStepsPerFrame directly affects the length of particle tails and the brightness of velocity changes.
