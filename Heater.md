![Heater burning fuel and vaporizing water.](/images/Heater.jpg "fig:Heater burning fuel and vaporizing water.")
**Heater** (**Hot** in OSX) is the opposite of [Cooler](/Cooler.md "Cooler"). It burns things and makes water-based materials turn into Steam. It melts meltable objects, and it can also be mixed and poured.

### Uses

Heater is a key component in [electricity](/Electrical%20Conduction.md "Electrical Conduction"). [CoolHeat](/Cool%20Heat.md "Cool Heat") can melt and burn but not evaporate Water. Liquid Hot (made by pressing *esc + H + esc*) never burns out, but also does not have the fire animation.
