**Rotational energy/Linear energy conversion** (Re/Le or Re->Le for short) is an effect in OE-Cake that causes spinning objects (that can break) to transfer linear energy to any pieces that break off the object.
An example of Re->Le conversion is the characteristics of [Baker particles](/Baker-Bertrand%20particle.md "Baker-Bertrand particle"), which fragment into smaller particles with less spin and more linear energy.

Another example of conversion can be seen here:
