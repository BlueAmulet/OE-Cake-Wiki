**Games are mini games for oe cake**

## Yo-yo

Such as The yo-yo

This game is played by creating a no gravity setting, and using the mochi-inflow particle creation property. for example: powder, mochi, inflow.

This mixture is placed center screen and the tool "arrow" is used to rotate a glob of the material around the center portion via the mochi/inflow property.

The goal is to achieve as many spins as possible without letting the material reconnect, stop spinning, or break off.

Tensile mochi inflow makes for a very strong yo-yo

Tricks:

Double yo-yo: build up enough spins to send out another yo-yo end, see how long you can keep the crazy double pendulum alive.

## Jigsaw Puzzle

You can create a jigsaw puzzle by creating a block of [Rigid](/Rigid.md "Rigid") from whatever image you want, and then using the [slice](/slice.md "slice") tool to cut it into several interlocking parts. You can then disassemble it, save the puzzle, and try to solve it yourself or send it to other people to solve.
