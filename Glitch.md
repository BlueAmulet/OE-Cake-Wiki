### Broken Save Files

When loading a save, sometimes things don't always go well! If you load your favorite save and find everything is all scrambled up, it can [often be fixed](/.oec%20File%20Manipulation.md#Un-breaking-a-Save ".oec File Manipulation"). Whatever you do, don't hit Save in the game or everything will be lost.
