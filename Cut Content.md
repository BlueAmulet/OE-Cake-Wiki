According to certain files found in the OSX version of OE-Cake, the developers had plans to make a much more detailed and capable engine. There are a number of cut tools that did not make the current version.

## BLUR

Not quite sure what this tool would have done. Soften edges, perhaps?

## CROP

<img src="/images/Crop.png" title="Crop.png" width="32" height="32" alt="Crop.png" />This tool seems to be the result of a series of tools for particle selection, perhaps to crop certain pre-selected particles?

## LASSO

<img src="/images/Lasso.png" title="Lasso.png" width="32" height="32" alt="Lasso.png" /><span>Another particle selection tool. Too bad this feature didn't make it to the final game, it would have made for a very different engine...</span>

## MARQUEE

<img src="/images/Marquee.png" title="Marquee.png" width="32" height="32" alt="Marquee.png" />Area select tool for particle selection.

## LINE

<img src="/images/Line.png" title="Line.png" width="32" height="32" alt="Line.png" />First of a series of advanced drawing tools. This one \*really\* would have made the game different, I don't know why it wasn't added.

## OVAL

<img src="/images/Oval.png" title="Oval.png" width="32" height="32" alt="Oval.png" />A useful tool for arbitrary ellipses.

## TEXT

<img src="/images/Type.png" title="Type.png" width="32" height="32" alt="Type.png" />Presumably, would have wrote letters using particles. Could be a useful feature if they found a way to consolidate resolution, especially because a custom fontset could be used to mass-produce small shapes.

## ZOOM

<img src="/images/Zoom.png" title="Zoom.png" width="32" height="32" alt="Zoom.png" />Oh boy what a loss. OE-Cake's greatest impediment was it's small map size and lack of a viewport. This tool alone could have made a powerful engine even more so, after performance has been taken into account. Many of the features of this tool can be accessed with the *scrollFlag* in the [Parameters](/Parameters.md "Parameters").
