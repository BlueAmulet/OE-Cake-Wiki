Eraser is a tool in OE-cake that erases things. it has the same shape as brush. There is no difference between Eraser and the Brush tool using [Delete](/Delete.md "Delete"), except that Brush can have it's width changed. It is not equivalent to the [Replace](/Replace.md "Replace") tool using Delete. Eraser seems to be the least spectacular tool, maybe it has a hidden function?
