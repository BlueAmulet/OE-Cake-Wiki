**Cooler**(**Cold**in OSX) is a material used for condensing [Steam](/Steam.md "Steam"), and the opposite of [Heater](/Heater.md "Heater"). Default Cooler contains Cold and Wall. Cooler "condenses" any material with Light + Gas + Water in it by removing the Gas and Light, leaving behind the Water. Cooler on it's own does not put out fires, unless combined with Water.

#### Uses

Cooler only detects Gas + Water, the Light part is not needed. [Liquid Gas](/Liquid%20Gas.md "Liquid Gas") can be created by condensing GW, making a non-Gas material with transparent particles. Cooler + Water makes a self-condensing liquid. Liquid Cold is one part of the [Pressure Sensitive](/Pressure%20Sensor.md "Pressure Sensor") material.
