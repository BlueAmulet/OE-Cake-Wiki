An **auxiliary element** is an element that has no unique behavior as a pure substance, but changes the behavior of another material in a unique way.

The auxiliary elements are [Brittle](/Brittle.md "Brittle"), [Rigid Axis](/Rigid%20Axis.md "Rigid Axis"), and the [technical elements](/Technical%20element.md "Technical element") [N-Null](/N-Null.md "N-Null") and [A-Null](/A-Null.md "A-Null"). All four of these materials are present in the [standard materials](/standard%20materials.md "standard materials") in some way, but cannot be obtained on their own without [Mix Mode](/Mix%20Mode.md "Mix Mode").

The [extraneous nulls](/Extraneous%20Nulls.md "Extraneous Nulls") are not auxiliary elements as they do not change the behavior of any other material in any unique way.
