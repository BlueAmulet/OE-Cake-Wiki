An OE-Cake level is a sandbox with a user element, usually mixed with powder or fuel, with the goal of getting it to a destination in one piece. A few examples of this can be found in my two level sets: [Level 1-3](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?rjyvwemdlmz) and [Level 4-6](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?fiwzkmzg4hz).

The goal here is to get your pink blob, box or other material into the green elastic in the white wall.

## Tips for level makers

To make a level, you need to consider the following things.

-   What are you going to make your player out of? Will it flow, ooze, bounce, roll or slide? Make it a different colour from everything else.
-   What is going to get in the way? The drain, a chance of burning, or something else?
-   What techniques can you use?
    -   First of all, look at wall-jumping. Works a treat.
    -   Next, look at mochi-flying. A small blob of mochi can allow your player to fly, but a big blob will swallow them up!
    -   Finally, can you complete it multiple ways? Sometimes it's best to make a shortcut, but that's your choice.

-   Is it possible? Make sure it's actually possible to get to the end of the level using just the keyboard. If it's not, refine it.

-   Solutions. Do a solution video with FRAPS, and put it on YouTube, in case anyone gets stuck.
