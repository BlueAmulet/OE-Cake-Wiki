Welcome to the main page of this wiki!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When editing this page, please note a few things:

-   The inexperienced may want to check out the "How to help" section on the "community portal" article linked on the sidebar.
-   Remember this page is the most public face of the wiki - test edits are best done on a separate page.
-   Sections within "\<! --" and "-- >" markers (without the spaces) - like this entire section - are hidden comments, and can be separated by several lines. Be sure not to break them.
-   We strongly recommend you do not change the <mainpage-rightcolumn-start /> style tags - these keep your page format safe from unexpected breaks - the right column is first, followed by the left column. See <http://help.wikia.com/wiki/Help:Main_page_column_tags> for more info.

Please note that Wikia protection policy advises against the protection of this page unless it is the active target of vandalism.

-   Protecting the main page can do more harm than good, for example by preventing links being added.
-   See <http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Protection> for more info.

*[OE-Cake!](http://www.octaveengine.com/en_casual/oecake) is a 2.5D fluids-based demonstration program for Prometech Software Inc's Octave Engine. In the program, which acts as a physics-based paint program, users can insert [objects](/object.md "object") and see them interact under the laws of physics. It has an advanced fluid simulation, and support for things as [gases](/gas.md "gas"), [rigid](/rigid.md "rigid") objects or even [elastic](/elastic.md "elastic"). With the [escape-codes](/Mix%20Mode.md "Mix Mode"), users can also mix the properties of [elements](/Material.md "Material") together. You can also add pictures to the simulation!!!*

If you really want to help out, post OE-Cake videos on Youtube and talk about it on social networking sites, so that OE-Cake doesn't become lost! How many people will even read this? I hope enough that we find at least a few willing to contribute to the wiki, OE-Cake has so much to find.

Also, in an effort to discover how busy the OE-Cake community is, we have decided to implement a human-counter to determine what percentage of the page views are caused by people, and what percentage is caused by other internet beings such as bots, scrapers, crawlers, indexers, and who knows what else.
