A **substep interaction** is some interaction between particles that occurs between [physics steps](/Physics%20step.md "Physics step").

It is roughly analogous to the Planck time unit in real life, the shortest interval it is possible to measure. Interactions that occur faster than this duration cannot be defined. In the game, the real-life duration of a timeStep depends on how many particles are present and their computational cost in [materials](/Material.md "Material") based on given [parameters](/parameters.md "parameters"), but in-game always represents the absolute interval by which all is measured. It represents the inter-frame behavior of particles. [Teleportation](/Teleportation.md "Teleportation") is a form of substep interaction, or the lack thereof. Many glitches are the result of OE-Cake's relatively low [temporal resolution](/Quantum%20Physics.md#Quantized-Units-and-Temporal-Precision "Quantum Physics"). Quantum physics as it relates to the game is the study of how particles behave over the shortest timeframes. [Supercriticality](/Supercriticality.md "Supercriticality") derives energy from substep interactions.
