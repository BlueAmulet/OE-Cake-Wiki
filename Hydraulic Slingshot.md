This page is about the design and use of a particular machine that can be made in OE-Cake. Through the use of [Hydraulic Pressure](/Hydraulic%20Pressure.md "Hydraulic Pressure") it is possible to stretch elastic, storing energy to fling a projectile.

### Usage

if you resize the window to your screen, make sure the slingshot is positioned in the top-left corner of the screen. To increase power, press the period button to engage Pour (Inflow) mode. Press again to stop adding power, for example when the elastic band is completely stretched. To fire the bomb, make sure it is almost touching the pouch by gently moving it against the pouch. Delete the red catch holding the pouch back, and the bomb will be fired. To aim the slingshot, delete the piece of Wall near the tip, aim, and use the Bucket tool to fill the section with Wall again. The slingshot can be reused and fire a wide variety of projectiles such as those seen in the Projectiles section of the [How to Build A...](/How%20to%20Build%20a.md "How to Build a...") page.

### Building a Slingshot

Constructing a slingshot requires understanding of these topics:

-   [Linking Particles](/Linking%20particles.md "Linking particles")
-   [Hoses](/How%20to%20Build%20a.md#Hoses "How to Build a...")
-   [Pistons](/How%20to%20Build%20a.md#Pistons "How to Build a...")
-   Type B [Spin-Charged Elastic](/Spin-Charged%20Elastic.md "Spin-Charged Elastic")

The basic shape is easy. You can copy mine exactly. You need to link the parallel pistons, which synchronizes them, as well as generating lateral support to the piston heads for the elastic to attach. The hose is optional but I intended for mine to be aimable.

The Spin-Charged Elastic glitch is the hardest part about designing anything in OE-Cake - Elastic can only be molded and worked on ONCE, when it is first drawn and you haven't unpaused yet. Please be sure to read the Type B section in the Spin-Charged Elastic article. Other than this glitch, the rest of the build process should be done with just the Rectangle tool. Pro tip: Draw a big block first, then use Delete to remove sections. This keeps everything aligned and spaced perfectly.
