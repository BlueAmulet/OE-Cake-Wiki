Depending on what you believe about physics and how OE-Cake's results relate to the real world, I believe it is possible to simulate something that resembles a time crystal - a theoretical object that has a repeating structure and organization over the time dimension, with movement an integral part of it's being it never finds equilibrium, yet you can't extract energy from it, the motion can't be used to perform work of some kind. It's not like OE-Cake follows laws regarding the conservation of energy or anything, but it does have some physics that can form unusual self-moving structures that have a unique temporal structure. One such example is the [Powder-Snow reaction](/Powder-Snow%20Reaction.md "Powder-Snow Reaction"), which forms undulating masses of particles that never stop moving but also kinda can't really be used to move things. OE-Cake basically only simulates baryonic matter so it's not like we can make an energy field or something, but it may be possible to classify the particle motion as wave-like or phononic. Technically if you built an elaborate and delicate machine you could probably have the tentacle spaghetti push very lightweight objects around for you, and it's not like the energy for this reaction actually "comes from anywhere" it's just there which is stretching the definition of a time crystal. But I think this reaction poses quite the inspiration for thought experiments at least.

The video below is my 4-dimensional visualization of the Powder-Snow reaction. Basically I recorded the material for a few minutes, then stacked all of the video panes together so we can see the incremental changes, then panned along a small section of the stack to give the impression of motion within a confined volume.
