Supercritical Elastic is a state of [Elastic](/Elastic.md "Elastic") that is made by replacing a [Supercritical](/Supercriticality.md "Supercriticality") or Quasi-Critical material with Elastic, or by setting [standardDistance](/Parameters.md "Parameters") to a smaller number (like 0.3) and making a small square of elastic.

## Behaviour

Supercritical Elastic is somewhat similiar to [Anti-Elastic](/Anti-Elastic.md "Anti-Elastic") in it's look, but is diffrent in behaviour.

Supercritical Elastic in very small amounts can sometimes act as a sort of "pin" of elastic. It makes the elastic less sensitive to [Gravity](/Gravity.md "Gravity"). This usually happens when the replacing process mostly covers non-supercritical or non-quasicritical parts of the liquid, with only a small section being truly Super/Quasi-critical.

Supercritical Elastic in bigger amount acts pretty similiar to Anti-Elastic, but pulls instead of pushing. It likes to stay in the centre. Bigger amounts of Supercritical Elastic get very laggy very fast.
