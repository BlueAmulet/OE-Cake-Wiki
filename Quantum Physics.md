![The extreme pressures in the center of a Mochibomb cause severely glitched behavior, causing randomness to break down into ordered patterns\|alt=\|512x512px](/images/Atomic.png "fig:The extreme pressures in the center of a Mochibomb cause severely glitched behavior, causing randomness to break down into ordered patterns|alt=|512x512px")OE-Cake's physics are not only capable of simulating quantum effects, but are subtly influenced by them in all reactions. Some of the most difficult to explain behaviors such as [Nova Viscous](/Viscous.md "Viscous"), [Electrical Conduction](/Electrical%20Conduction.md "Electrical Conduction"), and the [Painlevé Paradox](/Painlev%C3%A9%20Paradox.md "Painlevé Paradox") are probably rooted in quantum effects. [Fusion Bombs](/Fusion%20Bomb.md "Fusion Bomb") take advantage of quantum effects to produce a large explosion from few starting particles. The [Sonic Boom](/Sonic%20Boom.md "Sonic Boom") reaction is a result of the same principles. [Temperature](/Temperature.md "Temperature") and [Pressure](/Pressure.md "Pressure") are emergent particle quantum behaviours. The [Infinite Velocity](/Infinite%20Velocity%20Bug.md "Infinite Velocity Bug") bug falls under this umbrella as well. [Teleportation](/Teleportation.md "Teleportation") is a direct consequence of particle movement. [Magnetism](/Magnetism.md "Magnetism") is an emergent behavior when the temperature of one particle in an entangled pair is modulated.

[Jetstreaming](/Jetstream.md "Jetstream") and [Blurstreaming](/Blurstreaming.md "Blurstreaming") are techniques that are capable of visualizing some of the subatomic forces that particles are subjected to. Many of these concepts have been twisted and interpreted with artistic liberty from my limited understanding of them, this article is mainly food for thought regarding the behavior of the game.

  

### Subatomic Effects

#### Background

The particles in OE-Cake are subjected to many sub-atomic forces that determine their behavior. I am defining "sub atomic" as forces that primarily affect only the behavior of a single particle, which then produce larger tangible effects through masses of particles. There are some "invisible forces" that have no visual representation within the game that are used to calculate particle behavior - particle [spin](/Polarization.md "Polarization") is a good example of this, since it's possible for the particle to have a "polarization" or direction value that is separate from it's base spin speed. A particle can rotate but also has an "up" direction with no visual representation. Particle spin also has inertia, which represents another hidden variable to behavior that is not readily apparent especially if one is playing in Circles viewing mode.

#### Imaginary Particles and Subatomic Forces

[Ghostface-Killah Deflection](/Ghostface%20Killah%20Deflection.md "Ghostface Killah Deflection") is a practical example of "imaginary particles" that influence real behavior. In real life, a "particle" is pretty much any disturbance to the electromagnetic field that makes up the background of the universe. The release of visible light from hot objects is a good example of this, and is actually somewhat related to the Jetstreaming effect. In real life, the atoms in a hot material are vibrating so fast and so vigorously that a certain percentage of their movement is around the same amplitude and frequency as red/orange light - when a particle shakes back and forth really fast it traces out the shape of a photon, and some of the energy lost to fighting against inertia is cast away from the particle. Since some of the energy has been radiated away from the thermal mass, and that energy is the exact shape and size as a photon, our eyes register this radiated energy as the hot glow. In the Ghostface-Killah reaction, the Ø particle (analogous to a photon) essentially doesn't exist as far as the game is concerned, but it is a useful tool to describe the behavior of the other particles. When several Tensile+Fuel+Hot particles are orbiting eachother, their forces are balanced. When the Fuel particle degrades, its mass is no longer balancing the orbit and it appears to the other particles as if they were just hit by an equal and opposite invisible force than the amount of energy the Ø particle contained, instantaneously. There isn't actually a particle or any forces there, but it can be mathematically useful to describe the reaction as containing a negative particle or ghost energy in the form of a photon.

#### Subatomic Forces in Material Behavior

[Viscous](/Viscous.md "Viscous") is capable of damping the rotation of individual particles. As a material it converts shear forces into particle rotation, and each particle provides both linear and shear damping. Each particle in the game is not really a little round ball like a marble, it is actually a bubble of force but with an edge, kinda like a stress ball. At low forces particles tumble along like marbles, but at higher forces they start to squish together. This helps modulate the rotational damping of Viscous, because pressure reduces the radius of torque. Thus the precise damping ability of Viscous is determined by forces acting "within" the particle itself, and the internal state of individual particles then influences the behavior of the mass as a whole.

The [Powder-Snow Reaction](/Powder-Snow%20Reaction.md "Powder-Snow Reaction") is the result of subatomic forces at play - the Powder and Snow variables combine together to create a net force within the particle itself, then when this force is influenced by hundreds of other particles, quite unusual behavior is the result.
![The Powder-Snow Reaction is the result of subatomic forces](/images/Isotope%200.563 "fig:The Powder-Snow Reaction is the result of subatomic forces")

#### Phonons

Another way to think about "imaginary particles" that influence OE-Cake is that of "phonons" which are waves of motion through ordinary matter that are analogous to the waves of motion through electromagnetism that represent photons. Phonons in real life represents sounds and vibrations. Every time you see a shockwave traveling through air or water, that is a phonon. If you drop a block of Rigid onto a volume of water, the slight reverberating shockwave that travels out from under it is a phonon. That shockwave isn't really a single particle of it's own, but mathematically speaking it has a beginning, an end, and it has a certain amount of energy and a frequency, which classifies it as a "pseudoparticle" which is a particle made of the larger scale correlations in the behavior of more fundamental units. The surface of the vibration is formed by the individual particles working together to change their internal state, a collection of subatomic forces spread over a large area. Unless the *staticPressureFlag* is enabled, the readily apparent "edge" of a "pressure" wave does not actually have an internal pressure calculation or variable associated with it. The form emerges naturally out of particle location, speed, and a fixed *repulsionCoefficient*.  

### Quantum Effects

#### Background

OE-Cake doesn't have any in-game behaviors comparable to real quantum effects that I'm aware of, and anything simulated is allegorical at best. [Substep interactions](/Substep%20Interactions.md "Substep Interactions") define behavior in a time interval shorter than one timeStep. It has its own whole host of effects that can only be described by quantization. Unless your computer is extremely fast in single-threaded performance, OE-Cake's temporal resolution is substantially limited compared to its spacial resolution. The game is generally poor at real-time performance so the steps between frames become quite distinct.

The "electrons" found in [electrical conduction](/Electrical%20Conduction.md "Electrical Conduction") may represent pseudoparticles that exhibit properties vaguely similar to real electrons - constant motion and a difficult to measure location best described as a probability. Since OE-Cake doesn't have any mechanism to simulate entanglement or subatomic particles for true quantum effects, I am hijacking the term to repurpose it to describe the unusual behaviors in the game caused by a quantized device (the computer) trying to simulate a continuous universe, as an umbrella term for both errors imparted by quantization, as well as bitwise programming errors that produce quantity/counting/magnitude problems. OE-Cake is simultaneously a deterministic and non-deterministic program at the same time.

#### Quantized Units and Temporal Precision

These effects represent the lowest order of glitches, assembly glitches if you will. The [Painlevé Paradox](/Painlev%C3%A9%20Paradox.md "Painlevé Paradox") is caused by the quantization of space and time in the game. The quantization of time has a much greater presence within the game's behavior due to some quirks of computing. OE-Cake is a 32-bit program and many of it's behaviors can be explained by [floating-point](/Floating-Point%20Numbers.md "Floating-Point Numbers") limitations. On a 1080p display this would provide about 2.2 million points of horizontal particle location precision per pixel and even more vertically, more than enough.

This high degree of location precision permits simulations of an extreme scale to run, I think I have ran turbulence simulations with half a million particles before which takes up quite a large area. However the granularity of time is considerably lower, I believe the game is limited to 24fps internally, and the number of physics steps per frame is variable but set to 8 by default, giving a mere 192 time steps per second and only if your computer can maintain 24fps with your simulation. It is only possible to have higher degrees of time precision with extremely small simulations so that the computations can be completed within the allotted time. The number of physics steps per frame can be set to basically any number but in my experience, with just 3 particles on the screen I was only able to maintain 24fps with less than 512 steps per frame, 12288 physics steps per second, meaning that the game peaks at less than even 16-bits per second temporal precision and is single-digit at default settings.

The low temporal precision in this game (and many others to be fair) is what permits particles to "teleport" through things at a high enough speed, or for objects to overlay on each other when slammed together hard enough. According to the game's calculations, the particles need to move X units this physics step, which happens to be right inside another object. If the game was continuously variable in nature, it would be able to calculate the precise impact time, location, and force. However due to its quantized nature, the object is not actually moving smoothly through space, but stepping along in increments that represent motion, with an attached speed/inertia value that Blurstreaming visualizes. This causes a quite notable loss in accuracy for fast-moving particles in general, forcing the user to carefully set bounds for their simulation that keeps particle speeds within the accurate range, which can be enforced with the *maxSpeed* Parameter.

Higher speeds are fine to use as long as one plans and accounts for the loss of accuracy, such as by increasing particle count to encourage contact, or by using a very large simulation so that the errors average out, or by only taking results from a zone where particles are moving at an accurate speed. This is vaguely analogous to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle that states it is impossible to know a particles precise speed and location - in OE-Cake the slower a particle is moving the more precisely we can know its location, the faster it's moving the less precisely we can know its location, which is why they can "teleport" at high enough speeds - in real life the probability cloud of possible locations becomes so large that it can move totally past a solid obstruction, in the game the increment of movement becomes so large an object can step right through. In real life, [temperature](/temperature.md "temperature") and thus, particle speed, is the deciding factor that determines a particles ability to teleport.

  

#### Quantum friction

Fluids in OE-Cake have a natural internal friction to them that resists turbulent flows and encourages laminar flows, but only at low simulation resolution. This is because all fluids in OE-Cake are quantized - made up of individual measurable particles. I mean, everything in real life is made of individual particles too, but the scales are wildly different. In OE-Cake the diameter of a particle has a significant quantity relative to the size of the simulation. When you try to simulate fluid flow with too few particles, a very large percentage of the particle movement is going to be determined by particle geometry - a significant quantity of force will be spent on particles moving in directions tangential to that of the fluid flow, as they jostle and bump past each other. It costs energy to constantly correct the inertia of particles to be in-line with the fluid flow, generally causing flows to lose high-frequency details. A small quantity of particles is simply incapable of simulating high frequency fluid flows due to geometric limitations. Raising the simulation resolution (changing *scale* in the Parameters and using more particles) permits the resolution of higher-frequency components to the fluid flow as well as averaging out the non-flow component of particle motion. If fluids were continuous in OE-Cake we would not see this unusual internal fluid friction.

Rigid and Axis (probably every material but they're harder to quantify) also display unusual behavior that cannot be explained through conventional means. I don't even know enough about the phenomena to decide if it is truly a quantum effect or not but this is currently the best place to discuss it. Rigid structures drawn with smaller *standardDistance* values display a markedly reduced ability to rotate. Structures basically can't be rotated without exceptional forces around 0.3, but even the default of 0.75 produces a significant rotational damping effect that stops Rigid from spinning forever. The only way to avert this is to draw and then bind Rigid into a lattice density greater than 1 so none of the particles are contacting, severely limiting the utility of rotating rigid mass for energy storage, for example as a flywheel, requiring the masses to be rotationally decoupled from each other and the drivetrain.

The nature of the effect is unknown, though I suspect that something about the nature of particle [polarization](/polarization.md "polarization") is at play. There may be some energy loss converting the rotational energy of the whole mass into individual linear particle motions which would actually make this a quantum error due to limitations in counting/lossless force conversion. Why exactly this gets worse with higher particle densities is beyond me. Since Reynods number and vorticity represent rotational flow in a fluid, perhaps the fluid friction that resists turbulence and the Rigid rotational damping are two sides of the same coin, showing that OE-Cake has a lossy simulation of rotation? And yet somehow individual particles can spin forever with no friction perhaps because they are the least dense structure possible and thus can't have rotational damping?

Experimentations involving Gas and Water in a centrifuge are inconclusive but point to the heavy rotational damping being a characteristic only of Rigid. Though fluids can't reach the same densities as Rigid, they can still reach densities of around 0.5 safely which is quite dense enough for the effect to rear its head, which should show up as shear flow as the bottom layers of fluid would be more heavily compressed and thus, more heavily dampened than the upper layers, producing a net flow. However it is established that Gas is not one of the materials that responds to polarization, thus, Viscous would be a much better candidate for testing rotational damping, though I honestly can't remember if it had any funny behavior in a centrifuge.

#### Quantum behavior of Viscous

[Anti-Viscous](/Viscous.md "Viscous") provides another tool for us to observe the quantization of time and space within the game's universe. Anti-viscous has distinctly non-linear behavior, resembling that of a diode. The tiniest input of force quickly grows into an extreme amount of motion with a profile determined by the degree of negativity in the Viscous parameter. At a certain point, the Brownian/thermal motion of the particles has enough force to begin the reaction, since particles are rarely ever at true rest. If the simulation was truly continuous in nature, given the current programming they would eventually reach a point of total equilibrium where all forces are balanced and no fluid particle is in motion, or it would permit the amplitude of the motion to reach such a low level as to be negligible. The relatively long time interval between physics steps permits the "error force" to build up to a notable degree and then makes it hard to dissipate due to fewer steps creating an average, causing the extreme values to be more significant. Anti-viscous thus allows us to probe the settling temperature of particles, because its non-linear nature produces a large visible reaction from even the tiniest movements. Slowly increasing the magnitute of negative viscosity allows you to find the precise value at which the quantum Brownian motion of the particles is sufficient to cause the particles to nova, allowing measurement of the effect of the *dampingFlag* on temperature, and precisely correlating physics behavior in the game with several well-defined Parameter values.

Nova Viscous may be a purely quantum glitch in the game, if my assumptions are correct the glitch is caused by a Viscous particle becoming perfectly overlaid onto another particle. When the particles share the exact same location coordinates for even a split second, the distance between them is 0 and this breaks the Viscosity programming, possibly causing an integer overflow or maybe the division by 0 introduces a NaN value into the calculation. This then sets the speed of the Viscous particle to MAX, whatever that might be, causing it to spaz hard, for a long time.The quantized nature of the speed values for the particles provide a finite range of valid speeds. If the particle speed and location could be determined to continuous precision rather than our 32-bit and temporally limited precision, either the particles would not be able to share the exact same location, or the 0 in the equation would only have a small and temporary effect on the speed measurement. The Nova particles can stop moving if they hit an object that can dispel all the force, such as Wall or a large enough volume of non-Wall particles. I'm unsure if the particles will continue forever if uninterrupted, or if they are "charged" with a certain amount of energy from the reaction that they slowly burn through at impacts. [Compressed Particles](/Compressed%20particle.md "Compressed particle") differ from Nova Viscous in that all of the particles have a correlated inertia component, despite all of the particles sharing the same location their other forces are entangled as well and the deterministic nature of the game permits all the stacked particles to behave precisely the same, maintaining their correlation. When a Nova Viscous particle momentarily shares the same position as another particle under pressure, they have different inertial histories and internal forces which prevents the particles from being so similar that they become fully entangled.

#### Quantum Temperature and Particle Uncertainty

In OE-Cake, the quantized nature of the simulation puts a limit on how quickly and how far the particles can settle. Entropy and/or various damping losses may permit a particle or mass of particles to fully settle eventually but at default settings all particles that were previously in motion maintain a certain minimum rest energy for a very long time. The very low temporal resolution and lack of resting-state programming causes the particles to frequently overreach the point of stability because they can move quite far per physics step, allowing them to overlap the tiniest bit which generates a proportional reaction force to separate them. This will then nudge a few other particles a bit over the edge which causes them to get a reactionary bump as well, leading to a continuous process where uncertainty caused by relatively large quantized temporal sampling errors keeps a fluid jittering slightly above absolute zero. The relatively long temporal sampling intervals permits a large error to build up, which makes the effective settling temperature fairly high, high enough that the error is around 1 part in 16, ie. a particle is 16 pixels diameter and at rest is capable of jittering 1 pixel either direction, implying an error in calculating the particles position of 6.25% per physics step at 24 frames per second and 8 steps per frame. Even if you repeatedly eliminate all inertia (Shift+;) a particle will still begin jittering.

This is why the *dampingFlag* [Parameter](/Parameters.md "Parameters") exists, it's a crutch that bleeds energy from the system, allowing particles to settle by causing them to lose (by default) 5% of their speed every time they touch another particle, encouraging static resting states and permitting stiction. The quantum uncertainty in a particle's location seems to be directly correlated with how fast the simulation is running, setting a single Rigid particle on top of two Wall particles should produce a stable state right? The Rigid particle ought to settle between the two Wall particles and not move from there, but it doesn't. If you then raise *timeStepsPerFrame* very high to like 128 or more, [Blurstreaming](/Blurstreaming.md "Blurstreaming") allows us to observe the relatively large uncertainty in the particle's position. You can see the tail of the particle, which represents the forces it is experiencing, is extremely jittery, making it quite apparent the particle is not actually in a stable state even with Damping enabled. I believe if you set the timeSteps even higher to around 512 the uncertainty in the particle's location can become so high it spontaneously hops right off the Wall. Changing the value higher and lower changes how much the particle jitters, which is quite comparable to Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principle - by increasing the precision in which we measure the particle's position in time, the less accurately we can know its position in space.

#### Quantum Pressure and the Sonic Boom reaction

We have all seen that odd problem that happens when you compress things too much. If you squeeze Water or Gas very hard, at a certain point it just explodes. This is caused from quantization of the RNG values and particle pressure values interacting with the low temporal resolution - the game can only simulate pressures up to a certain level, so when two particles are pressed onto the same location by enough force, the *repulsionCoefficient* tries to separate them with an infinite force, sending the particles catapulting away at *maxSpeed*. At small magnitudes this reaction causes particles to step on eachother's toes repeatedly until all particles have been cast far away from the high-pressure area and pressure falls to the point the reaction can no longer continue, and since all the particles are travelling quite quickly they are capable of warping away from the source zone in almost no time. If the game was continuously variable in nature, the particles would not be able to be compressed onto eachother perfectly, they would have a smoother ability to be overpressured, and they would not leap and skip away from their original locations to cause havok elsewhere. At extreme levels, with tremendous levels of force and particle counts, the game is unable to maintain the illusion of emergent randomness and the probability waveform for the particle locations is no longer Gaussian.

The linked video below shows an example of the breakdown of randomness in the center of an extremely large Mochi nova, where order forms out of chaos. The explosion is so large that there is a very large area at which the particles are above the quantum pressure, and they are constrained from exiting this zone by the rate they can travel - maxSpeed. If the RNG was able to supply an infinite quantity of random numbers, the randomness would be fully continuous. However even randomness is quantized into discrete units, which means that a) there is only so much randomness the computer can generate, and b) when the ability to generate randomness has been surpassed, particles are given the same number as other particles which causes their behavior to become [entangled](/Entanglement.md "Entanglement").

The video below demonstrates a quantum glitch in the randomness, what should just be a thermal cloud of static noise from the explosion has undulating ribbons of force. I am unable to determine the precise particle motions that lead to the creation of this structure, I suspect the particles are not moving slowly at all but are rapidly warping back and forth creating an interference pattern with the physics steps of the game. The behavior of these "atomic ribbons" may shed some light on the anisotropic nature of [Electricity](/Electrical%20Conduction.md "Electrical Conduction"), since again the randomness of the waves has a pattern to it. The waves are located mostly on the right side of the nova, and are traveling from left to right, and the fact they formed vertically has to mean something. It is probably possible to use [Jetstreaming](/Jetstream.md "Jetstream") to further narrow down the particle motion. See [Super-Dense Material](/Super-dense%20material.md "Super-dense material") for another discussion of this phenomena.

==== Determinism Paradox ====
As I said at the beginning of this section, OE-Cake is both deterministic and non-deterministic. The program IS actually fully deterministic, in that identical starting conditions and runtime parameters will produce identical simulations after any time interval. However several factors combine together to generally force the program to be non-deterministic. OE-Cake takes constant advantage of your computer's random-number generator in order to produce a more accurate simulation. I'm not sure exactly how or where but the RNG has an effect over the entire simulation. If multiple simulations are all run from the same thread in your computer, they will all be provided the same random number at every step, and every instance will evolve exactly the same as every other instance. However typically multiple simulations each have their own thread and will be given a unique random number. The OSX version of OE-Cake permits opening multiple simulations under a single host process, causing each to share the RNG and permitting the simulations to evolve in-sync. Launching multiple instances of OE-Cake and running each simulation on a separate thread seeds each simulation differently, allowing them to differ from eachother after any given time interval. For this reason I'd argue the program is truly deterministic, given identical starting conditions and delivering the same RNG to it will produce an identical result every time. Though without randomness would it really be an emergent physics simulator? If the ball fell in the same hole every time would that be exciting gameplay? This mostly only affects the repeatability of shared experiments but in a quite inconsequential way if the simulation is designed properly. This determinism paradox would exist whether the simulation was quantized or not, however the rather low temporal resolution permits the systems to diverge quite rapidly because there are fewer data points to create a suitable averaging effect and outliers are more significant.
