A **Bomb** is an [object](/object.md "object") that explodes, spreading [materials](/material.md "material") around the sandbox. It usually revolves around a [combination](/combining.md "combining") of [Powder](/Powder.md "Powder"). There are multiple types of bomb, each with different characteristics.

## Acid Bomb

An Acid Bomb is an object that spreads large amounts of acid that vanish into thin air after destroying everything around it and eating holes in farther away objects. The explosive is POSFIM, a globular mix that dissolves whatever it touches except for string. Therefore, the bomb casing has to be ESF or something like it, string that breaks easily under the pressure of the expanding acid and burns away to nothing when ignited. To make an acid bomb, pause the game and draw a thick layer of ESF with a paintbrush in, say, 1.5 size writing. Then fill it up with POSFIM. If the bomb dissolves whatever it touches before you put fire into the middle of the POSFIM, make the casing of ESF thicker. If you just want to godmod explosions everywhere, skip the casing and use POHJFIM, which explodes the instant you finish drawing a line of it.

You can also create a more realistic air-dropped bomb by hitting Pause, then making a frame of Fuel, leaving very little space at either the top or the bottom for a small amount of Fire. Place the POSFIM in the rest of the bomb, taking care not to touch the Fire while mid-air. Once the bomb makes impact, the Fire will be displaced from it's original position, and hit the POSFIM, triggering an explosion.

## Nuclear Bomb

![IFM-based Nuclear bomb detonation, the blast will virtually obliterate any flammable material.](/images/Nuke.png "IFM-based Nuclear bomb detonation, the blast will virtually obliterate any flammable material.")

Nuclear Bombs involve [Inflow](/Inflow.md "Inflow"). The basic layout is an outer shell of a form of Rigid (Powder or fuel), with a combination of Inflow and [Fuel](/Fuel.md "Fuel") or Powder inside. The detonator (Gas + Heater or Fire usually) is often insulated from the main explosive by a buffer (Commonly Mochi) to prevent aerial detonation. By manipulating the amount of buffer, the detonation time can be controlled. The blast from any type of nuclear bomb will usually destroy any flammable material in the sandbox. Adding [Outflow](/Outflow.md "Outflow") to the explosive will cause the blast to destroy *everything*, flammable or not!

There are a few kinds of Nuclear Bombs, including:

-   The Small, or Tactical version, which uses Inflow with Powder as a detonator,
-   The Hydrogen Bomb, which uses an outer shell of a [Powder](/Powder.md "Powder") mixture (to compress and fuse the gas inside of it when detonated), with an inflow of Fuel-Gas.
-   The Compartment Bomb, which uses RP as a shell, with several segments containing PRIG, FRIG, RIF, and RIP.
-   The Impact Bomb, which isn't actually a bomb, but has the same effect as a Nuclear Bomb. The detonation relies on the fact that materials with Inflow and Mochi as components will expand rapidly on impact. The explosive mix IMT + either Fuel or Outflow is particularly effective.
-   The gas grenade, which is a RP shell filled with IOGF. When fire touches the shell, the flaming gas flows out destroying everything around.
-   The Jet Nuke, which contains two explosives, IJF and IMF. When the shell explodes,allowing the two substances to touch, the jet and mochi components react to fill the screen with flaming particles.
-   The Jet/Impact Nuke, Created by Firefly, which is a combo of the Hydrogen, Impact, and Jet nukes.
-   The Lava Nuke, Created by Final508, Uses a normal Rigid casing, The nuke does the same as the normal IFM bomb too, But ignites during its creation inside the Rigid (so it does not need any mochi or GH) . And will never disappear while it obliterating any flammable material or melting any kinds of meltable material (e.g. Elastic).

### Instructions to create one type of nuclear bomb

-   For the outer shell, use a combination of Rigid, and Powder. Make this a rectangular shape, the thin end facing the ground. Make this in the air for a proper detonation
-   After you create the outer shell, erase a small rectangular area, make sure it is still contained in the shell. Once you have done this, erase a much larger box directly above the small one, DO NOT LET THE CHAMBERS MERGE. This chamber should take up the rest of the shell.
-   Now you have created the outer shell for the bomb! Use a combination of Gas and Hot, put it smack-dab in the middle of lower chamber. Now use the bucket tool and fill the lower chamber with Mochi.
-   Then, make a mixture with Inflow, Mochi, and Fuel. Put this in larger chamber.
-   Un-pause it, and bombs away!<img src="/images/ImpactJet.png" title="fig:Proper Contruction of a Impact/Jet Nuke" width="135" alt="Proper Contruction of a Impact/Jet Nuke" />

### How to make the Jet/Impact Nuke

-   Pause (Hit space)
-   Make a shell out of RP (Esc, R, P, Esc, Shape, draw a rectangle)
-   Choose IFM (Esc, I, F, M). Put little boxes in the shell.
-   Choose IJM (Esc, I, J, M) (Getting the hang of it?) Put small boxes under it, but **VERY FAR APART FROM THE ORANGE STUFF**!
-   Choose IFG and put a large box under the light yellow stuff.
-   Hit space, and BOOM!

### Mix code to making an instant exploding Nuclear Bomb

This nuclear bomb explode immediately after its creation (it is for torturing your victim or destruction, not much use for user levels). The bomb is a mixture of Inflow, Gas, Heater and Fuel. Simply press the Escape button and press I, G, H, F and the Escape button again. Create it in a corner or on the side of the window for the best explosion. Work best with a dark background. And to vaporise your victim(s) add the letter D to the code combination (this is the best part of this nuclear bomb). The explosion is about 150 times the mass of its creation size.

### Lava Bomb

A bomb that shoots [Lava](/Lava.md "Lava"). One example would be HIFD@, which, when finished making, creates large amounts of Lava.
