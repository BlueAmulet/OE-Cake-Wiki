Gravity is a very powerful tool in OE-cake. It lets you change the amount of gravity in the simulation, it make make things impossible to lift or make them seem weightless. Also note that [gas](/Gas.md "Gas") is not affected by gravity what so ever. The force that [Light](/Light.md "Light") and [Dense](/Dense.md "Dense") push with is directly proportional to *gravityCoefficient*.

This is an advanced idea, but Gravity is also affected by time. What this means is, if you are trying to make a really long simulation, the longer it is the more extreme the Gravity will seem. Imagine if you are making a timelapse video that is 30x faster than normal, everything will seem to fall 30x faster as well so you would need to set gravity to 1/30 to make things seem normal in the final video.
