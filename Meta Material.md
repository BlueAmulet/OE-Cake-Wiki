A **metamaterial** is a material engineered to have unique properties based on structure.

[Sparse Elastic](/Sparse%20Elastic.md "Sparse Elastic") is an example of a metamaterial. It's high surface area and ordered pattern have interesting chemical and physical properties.

[Illuminated Gas](/Illuminated%20Gas.md "Illuminated Gas") is a metamaterial designed to produce a different graphical effect in the game.

[Gubraithian Fire](/Gubraithian%20Fire.md "Gubraithian Fire") is a material that never stops burning and adds speed to the [Fire](/Fire%20%28shader%29.md "Fire (shader)") particles, which enables [Jetstreaming](/Jetstream.md "Jetstream"). By editing Parameters it is possible to use it to observe the internal state of particles.

Meta materials are fairly unexplored in a large sense, but could have potentially interesting and useful properties.
