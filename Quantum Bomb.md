This is a *theoretical page* regarding the construction of a bomb that derives it's power from [quantum mechanical](/Quantum%20Physics.md "Quantum Physics") effects.

Under the right conditions, [Viscous](/Viscous.md "Viscous") can "go nova" due to a glitch which causes a certain number of particles to fly around aggressively, usually not the entire mass but just a few. The effect seems to be caused by "pinching" Viscous particles between other particles, such as crushing them with Rigid or throwing them very hard into Gas. Viscous would produce a bomb that is good at pushing due to the damping nature of the particles quickly shedding their momentum into the target, with fairly high yield due to the energetic reaction from a small number of particles.

If the exact nature of the Nova Viscous reaction can be determined, perhaps it would be possible to use some Powder or a Mochibomb to generate the initial force to begin the self-sustaining reaction.

Various [Parameters](/Parameters.md "Parameters") control the behavior of Viscous, perhaps tweaking maxSpeed, repulsionCoefficient, or the viscosity can have an effect on the material's ability to be stable until activated. Maybe it will be an impact bomb where kinetic energy provides the initial bump?

[Fusion Bombs](/Fusion%20Bomb.md "Fusion Bomb") are currently the most well known quantum bombs. A ring of explosives compresses a material containing Inflow which generates a [Sonic Boom](/Sonic%20Boom.md "Sonic Boom") reaction, causing an extreme quantity of particles to be generated.
