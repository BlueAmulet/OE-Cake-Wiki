![A-Null, N-Null, esc-A-Null, esc-N-Null](/images/Nulltypes.png "A-Null, N-Null, esc-A-Null, esc-N-Null")![Null liquid](/images/Null.jpg "Null liquid")The word **Null**is another way of saying the word nothing. The term "**Null**" is used to describe a few "hidden" materials. Null is always an inert fluid that just flows and doesn't have many interactions. It's essentially the default particles of OE-Cake.

Null does not burn, melt Snow, evaporate, or damage Elastic or String. This makes it useful when you need a liquid that does not interact with other important parts of your creation.

## Uses

Two keys produce the common types of Null: A and N. When you select the material with those keys (and not pressing escape) the two materials will have the same color. When you use the [Mix Mode](/Mix%20Mode.md "Mix Mode") by pressing *esc + A + esc* to make A-type Null, it is paler than normal. [N-Null](/N-Null.md "N-Null") is a bit more elusive, and trying to place N-Null just creates a [completely inert fluid](/True%20Null.md "True Null").

Null does not have the "surface water" effect that [Water](/Water.md "Water") does, which could be aesthetically useful.

Save-file analysis has revealed why A-type Null has a lighter color. A-type null represents the "surface material" of [Water](/Water.md "Water"), the paler particles that occur near the top of Water. A-type Null thus represents "surface water" and water without A-Null represents "deep water" or normal particles. This is why the game renders A-type null a paler color.

While you can place N-Null, it turns into [a third, extra type of null](/True%20Null.md "True Null"). It has no keybind, but it can be created with N-Null or by placing A-Null without toggling mix mode. If you try to place A-Null and it doesn't look light, then it probably turned into the third null type. It acts mostly the same as A-Null, but appears dark and can't be combined in mix mode.

A-type Null can be mixed with [Snow](/Snow.md "Snow") to produce a new hidden material. The material AY makes a paint-like material that acts like a normal fluid but sticks to objects. Unfortunately, N-Null doesn't seem to have any effects when added to recipes. It might not be possible to make a recipe with N-Null.

There are some [more types of Null](/Extraneous%20Nulls.md "Extraneous Nulls"), but they can only be accessed by editing [save files](/.oec%20File.md ".oec File"). However, they act just like other types of Null.
