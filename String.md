**String** is a stretchy, stringy, purple element. It is much more flexible than Elastic and slightly less stretchy. String is good at being a rope, a tether, or some cloth. String pulls with an exponential force, meaning it is really sloppy for low forces, but quickly pulls tight. String can be combined with Brittle to "snap" with enough force.

The [Standard Material](/Standard%20materials.md "Standard materials") made by pressing S is actually a recipe containing S+N. If the game is paused, drawing String and making a save shows that the material drawn is coded as 42000, and there are no joins in the file. After the game is unpaused, the material switches to 40000 and joins are formed. The role of [N-null](/N-Null.md "N-Null") in the material and if it has a relation to the joins is unknown.

### Uses

It's too sloppy and weak for most applications, often letting particles pass right through. With some Parameters tweaking, String can have a bit more personality.

Unlike [Elastic](/Elastic.md "Elastic"), String does not preserve the rotation between particles. String's particles are not rotationally attached to each other. When String rotates, the individual particles don't spin but they maintain relative locations. String particles can rotate when attached to other materials, however.

### Linking and Entanglement

The rotational de-coupling of String can be harnessed in OE-Cake to make incredible creations. Single-particle String [links](/Linking%20particles.md "Linking particles") between pieces of Rigid allow the pieces of Rigid to rotate freely, while still holding them at an exact distance. This allows the creation of utterly frictionless, invincible joints between pieces of things with almost no lag penalty.

It's property for ignoring rotation permits multiple String particles to be chained at arbitrary distances using [save file manipulation](/.oec%20File%20Manipulation.md ".oec File Manipulation"), as well as providing frictionless but strong pivots between structures with no group index penalty. By tethering String particles to particles with other physics behavior, it is possible to correlate their positions precisely.
