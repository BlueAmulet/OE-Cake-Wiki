**Entanglement** is when particles share internal states with each other, such as having correlated spin or inertia.

Compressed Particles

[Compressed Particles](/Compressed%20particle.md "Compressed particle") were discovered very early on in OE-Cake's lifespan. They perfectly share location, speed, and rotation between all particles, though it is not currently determined if this is because the particles are actually "communicating" and keeping each other together, or if simply because OE-Cake is a deterministic program and since every single particle is experiencing the same forces, they all take the exact same path.

  

### Mochi

Entanglement was observed very early but not recognized in the largest of [Mochibomb explosions](/Super-dense%20material.md "Super-dense material"). It is due to the limited quantity and resolution of randomness available to the game, causing particles to be delivered the same "random" value as other particles which would correlate their behavior.

### String

[String](/String.md "String") has been found to inherently have uses for entanglement. It's property for ignoring rotation permits multiple String particles to be chained at arbitrary distances, as well as providing frictionless but strong pivots between structures with no group index penalty. By tethering String particles to particles with other physics behavior, it is possible to correlate their positions precisely.

[Magnetism](/Magnetism.md "Magnetism") is an emergent property caused by modulating the [temperature](/temperature.md "temperature") of one of a pair of [entangled](/Entanglement.md "Entanglement") particles.
