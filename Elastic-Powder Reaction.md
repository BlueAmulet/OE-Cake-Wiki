[Elastic](/Elastic.md "Elastic") and [Powder](/Powder.md "Powder") exhibit the Elastic-Powder Reaction when combined (EP).

The result is a low-density material that shakes violently and floats in a seemingly arbitrary direction, mostly unaffected by gravity or other forces.

## Space Foam

Space foam, or EVP, is a much more stable variant of EP. Its stability makes it much more useful, as well as some additional properties.

### Uses

Space foam is particularly difficult to penetrate or [saturate](/Saturation.md "Saturation"), more so than EP or EV. It is capable of ejecting solid projectiles from itself as well, and it is very good at shock absorption. However, like EP, it is very flammable.
