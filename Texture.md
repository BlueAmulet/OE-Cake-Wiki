A **Texture** is a picture over a material. A texture is only well visible in Shader or Blob and Texture. Because liquids flow out almost immediately, they don't work as good. Some materials don't show the texture well:

-   Water
-   String
-   Powder
-   Viscous
-   Tensile
-   Fire
-   Dense
-   Light
-   Gas, which is too blurry to see details
-   Mochi, when the scene is unpaused
-   Rice, when it drops on the ground

Basically, every material without Rigid or Wall in it blurs the textures.

Textures can be made by dragging and dropping an image into the sandbox. The material the texture has is determined by the selected material.
