**Materials** are the main part of [OE-Cake](/OE-Cake.md "OE-Cake"), and consist of four groups.

[Material Theory](/Material%20Theory.md "Material Theory") is the study of their behavior and how they are programmed in the game.

[Material Science](/Materials%20Science.md "Materials Science") is the practical applications of such materials.

  
![Table of the Elements\|alt=\|none](/images/Elements.png "fig:Table of the Elements|alt=|none")An **element** is the base property in a material that adds special behaviour. The element of [Brittle](/Brittle.md "Brittle") on it's own has no special properties and acts like exactly like [Null](/Null.md "Null"). But when added to Elastic or String, it allows those particles to rip under enough force.

Examples include:

-   [Wall](/Wall.md "Wall"), creates a material that cannot move
-   [Elastic](/Elastic.md "Elastic"), creates a material that tries to return to it's original shape, and melts when it comes in contact with [Heater](/Heater.md "Heater").

[ thumb \|A few materials at work in OE-Cake.\|alt=\|noneThe](/imagematerials.png.md "image:materials.png") **[Standard materials](/Standard%20materials.md "Standard materials")** are the pre-combined, pre-colored materials that can be selected from the materials panel. These consist of one or more individual elements that are [combined](/Mix%20Mode.md "Mix Mode"). Examples include:

-   [Rice](/Rice.md "Rice"), combines the elements Rice, Elastic and [Viscous](/Viscous.md "Viscous")
-   [Snow](/Snow.md "Snow"), made up of Snow and Water
-   [Tensile](/Tensile.md "Tensile"), which is an element.

![Colored elements\|alt=\|none](/images/Colored%20elements.png "fig:Colored elements|alt=|none")**[Custom Materials](/Mix%20Mode.md "Mix Mode")**, made by combining single *elements* in [Mix Mode](/Mix%20Mode.md "Mix Mode"). These can be like Oil, which has a few different [recipes](/recipes.md "recipes"), for example [Fuel](/Fuel.md "Fuel") and [Tensile](/Tensile.md "Tensile"). Examples include:

-   Sticky Powder, which is explosive [Powder](/Powder.md "Powder") that sticks to an [object](/object.md "object"), and is made by combining [Mochi](/Mochi.md "Mochi") with [Powder](/Powder.md "Powder").
-   [Cool Heat](/Cool%20Heat.md "Cool Heat") liquifies steam, but does not evaporate Water. It can still melt [Elastic](/Elastic.md "Elastic") and [String](/String.md "String") or set things on fire. This is made by combining [Cooler](/Cooler.md "Cooler") with [Heater](/Heater.md "Heater").

![Soap-like material made by mixing Tensile and Gas\|alt=\|none](/images/MetaTensile.png "fig:Soap-like material made by mixing Tensile and Gas|alt=|none")**[Mixtures](/Mixture.md "Mixture")** are compound materials that are made by blending two materials containing different elements.

-   A material resembling soap can be made by shaking Tensile in an atmosphere of Gas
