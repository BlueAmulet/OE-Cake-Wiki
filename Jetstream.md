![Visual representation of Jet+Hot+Tensile being used to make a Sun\|alt=\|frame](/images/AnxiousUncommonArabianhorse-size%20restricted.gif "Visual representation of Jet+Hot+Tensile being used to make a Sun|alt=|frame")**Jetstreaming** is the act of using Jet + Hot to produce visual patterns. Setting *jetCoefficient* to different positive or negative numbers will change how fast and far a [Fire](/Fire%20%28shader%29.md "Fire (shader)") shader particle will be projected from the source, allowing you to create patterns that move with or against the source. Jetstreaming works best when the Fire shader [Parameters](/Parameters.md "Parameters") are set so that there is a 100% probability for Fire to be formed, and with a long enough lifespan to be useful. [Blurstreaming](/Blurstreaming.md "Blurstreaming") is another technique useful for visualizing particle effects.

Setting *jetCoefficient* to 0 will cause the Jet to leave a trace of its precise movements, allowing you to study the motion of individual particles. Jetstreaming is an effective technique to study the inner workings of certain particle reactions, because the distance that a Fire shader particle is cast from the Jet source particle is directly proportional to the force the Jet particle was subjected to - that means if the particle is hit lightly the Fire particle will be cast out slowly, and if the Jet particle is hit strongly the particle will be cast far and fast. It can also be used to monitor particle [Polarization](/Polarization.md "Polarization") since the Fire shader particles are always projected from the poles of the Jet particle.

By observing the patterns formed by the Fire shader you can see detailed information about tiny movements and large variations of force that an individual Jet particle was subjected to. Low *jetCoefficients* are effective at observing internal forces, such as measuring impacts or the strength of an explosion, because the Fire particles will be cast away only if there is a force. Higher *jetCoefficients* are effective at observing tiny, long-term trends in particle motion because the Fire being projected from the Jet particle will wave and undulate in response to it's motion.

The artistic images below were formed using Tensile, Mochi, Jet, and Hot and sometimes Rigid assisting with the [Tensile-Rigid reaction.](/Tensile-Rigid%20reaction.md "Tensile-Rigid reaction") The smooth and swirly patterns were formed mostly by Tensile particles orbiting eachother, and the dotted patterns were formed by rotating Tensile+Mochi particles, sometimes with Rigid added. By modifying the Tensile and Mochi [Parameters](/Parameters.md "Parameters") you can modulate the harmonic interference of the various forces that determine the particle's spin rate and how it interacts with the game's framerate due to [quantum effects](/Quantum%20Physics.md "Quantum Physics").

Jetstreaming can be used to probe the quantum depths of the game's engine, since it projects even the tiniest forces and motions into much larger structures that are easier to observe and measure. Any irregularities in the expected path or pattern can be caused by quantization of the particle paths. ![Jetstream being used to trace the path of a double pendulum\|left\|frame](/images/Double%20Pendulum%202-%20Director%27s%20Cut "Jetstream being used to trace the path of a double pendulum|left|frame")
