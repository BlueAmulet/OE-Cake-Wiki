**Steam**is a compound material with [Water](/Water.md "Water"), [Gas](/Gas.md "Gas"), and [Light](/Light.md "Light") in it, and any other compound material containing Water and Gas and Light will have similar properties. Steam is formed when any material containing Water touches any material containing [Heater](/Heater.md "Heater"). The Water-containing material gains Gas and [Light](/Light.md "Light") properties, even if mixed with Rigid. Steam condenses when it touches [Cooler](/Cooler.md "Cooler"), at which point the Gas and Light parts are removed.
