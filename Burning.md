**Burning** is a process in OE-Cake. This makes random pieces of [Fire](/Fire.md "Fire") or [Powder](/Powder.md "Powder") (or any material with Fuel or Powder+Hot mixed into it) disappear over time. The rate at which Fire Decay occurs can be modified in the [Parameters](/Parameters.md "Parameters") under the variable *fireExtinguishProbability*, which determines how long each particle lasts before it dies. There seems to be a glitch that simulates "heat" because burning particles in contact with other burning particles die faster than if they are on their own. Objects containing Fuel + Hot or Jet + Hot will produce the [Fire](/Fire.md "Fire") animation.
