It is theorized that OE-Cake is capable of a great many things beyond what appears on the surface. Such devices as mechanical calculators, digital computers, and cellular automata may be created. As of yet none have been published so this page is currently speculation.

## Mechanical

It is easy to imagine a variety of purely mechanical calculating devices. Such devices could be "hand cranked" by using the Mouse, powered by Jet, or the action of particles generating force. Powder can provide force, Mochi can make changes persistent.

  

### <u>Linked</u>

[Linking particles](/Linking%20particles.md "Linking particles") allow movement and force to be transmitted to remote locations. [String](/String.md "String") links allow almost frictionless operation. Rigid and String contraptions could quite easily create capable devices which require little energy to operate. However the game has a [built-in limit](/.oec%20File.md ".oec File") of 256 sections of Rigid which puts a hard cap of the complexity of such devices.

### <u>Unlinked</u>

Two classes of mechanical calculator can be created depending on their physical construction. A simple mechanical calculator can probably be made using "conventional" design practices from the "pre-Linking" days. Such devices would be much larger, probably less capable. An abacus would be one such example. Sadly unlinked creations are also victim to the Rigid body limit.

### <u>Analog</u>

Analog computers use devices such as pulleys, levers, and gears to manage inputs and calculate outputs. Such devices are usually produce continuous, graded outputs up to a certain accuracy rather than precise results.

### <u>Digital</u>

Digital computers use matter arranged in clearly defined states to produce granular results with defined units. Typically employing switches, toggles, and fast transitions, digital computers are incapable of half-steps but always provide an exact result.  

### <u>Hydro-Mechanical</u>

Computers could be created out of a connected series of pipes through which fluid pressure provides the force required to drive logic gates. Computers could also take advantage of Water's two-state nature, possibly creating binary storage devices. For example a T-shaped valve creates an XOR gate, if only one of the input pipes has water pressure the gate will swing open and allow water to pass, but if both input pipes have pressure the valve will remain upright and seal the output pipe. Obviously if both the input pipes don't have water there will also be no output, fully modelling an XOR gate.

### <u>Mechano-Chemical</u>

Physical reactions from the [elements](/Material.md "Material") can be used to power logic gates. Powder can provide propulsive force to open and close devices while Hot can provide the selective response. It would be necessary to tune Powder to have a more practical profile, as well as design a way to refresh the charges automatically while protecting the Inflow source. Alternatively the Powder could be set to never burn away then surrounded by a material containing Water which would extinguish the reaction after the Hot was removed, removing force and closing a gate. Powder could open and close physical gates which allow more powder to flow or perhaps expose a given charge to a Hot source.

  

### <u>Electro-mechanical</u>

Simple electrical connections could provide the physical change which activates Powder or changes the state of Water. Using conductive elements would likely speed up the calculation speed. Using Wall wiring would enable another material to be active in the device, which would take logical pressure off Rigid elements.

### <u>Nanomechanical</u>

Nanomachines take advantage of particular physics seen at scales nearing that of a single particle. Several effects are simply not possible in larger scale devices. The [Bistable switch](/Mechanical%20Switch.md "Mechanical Switch") is one example of a nanomachine which is functionally equivalent to a transistor.

  

## Chemical

It was always possible to use the physical behaviour of the materials to create mechanical/chemical hybrid devices. However with the discovery of the [Outer Nulls](/Extraneous%20Nulls.md "Extraneous Nulls") a new axis of complexity has been added. This allows up to 6 degrees of interaction between chemical components of a device.

### <u>Biological</u>

The Outer Nulls permit a new order of reactions to occur. It was already possible to create cell-like structures in various ways. By making a slightly pressurized atmosphere of Gas, blob-like shapes emerge from most materials. Naturally Tensile forms stable blobs due to it's oil-like behaviour. But if Jet is added to the Gas atmosphere or the cells, and set to an appropriately low value, more behaviour emerges. Elemental properties allow many behaviours to occur as well as promoting more complex interactions over time.

By having the edge of the screen made of IWG(J?) originating from different Nulls and the cells made of appropriate materials with their own Nulls, chemical signalling may allow these blobs to selectively absorb or repel certain elements, changing their internal state. Such a creation has not yet been made or shown to be effective.

  

## Electric

[Electricity](/Electrical%20Conduction.md "Electrical Conduction") of a sorts is an emergent behaviour in OE-Cake. By manipulating the [Parameters](/Parameters.md "Parameters") it is possible to cause certain materials to conduct a non-physical force, allowing extremely fast actions.

  

### Glitch

Normal conduction is probably not programmed into the game intentionally and thus may be considered a "glitch". The effect is certainly glitchy, with unexplainable behaviours. With enough wily determination it may be possible to take advantage of edge cases in the program to perform logical operations which affect particles in the sandbox.  

### Electro-Chemical

Similar to eletro-mechanical calculators, eletro-chemical calculators would depend more on the electricity interacting with specific particle physics and less on moving Rigid sections with embedded properties. Floating particles of Hot for example can sporadically trigger conductive lines. Modulated electricity can toggle Outflow to screen Hot particles.  

## Logic gates and Storage

This will be quite the section indeed once some discoveries are made about how the game runs such devices and their utility for simulations. The Outer Nulls permit hexary computations and memory storage - 5 times more operations and higher information density per particle than normal binary operations.
