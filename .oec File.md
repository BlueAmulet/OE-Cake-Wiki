[OE-Cake](/OE-Cake.md "OE-Cake") has a special file type, "\*.oec".

.oec files are created when you save a simulation and can be opened by the program and played.

See [.oec File Manipulation](/.oec%20File%20Manipulation.md ".oec File Manipulation") for techniques used to create more advanced content.

## File Structure

The .oec file is separated into 5 sections: header, particles, joints, parameters, and images.

### Header

The header appears at the beginning of the .oec file.

A header looks like this in OE-Cake version 1.1.2b, the version distributed on this site. Older version of OE-Cake have a slightly different header.

``` text
# OctaveEngine Casual (Jul 14 2008)
version 2
```

It is marked by the "#" character.  

### Particles

Under the header is a list of particles, which may look like this:

``` text
p 10000 0 ff 9999ffff 65.555 26.0352 -0.0136349 -0.000272369 143 25.75 0 0 0 
```

A particle is marked by the "p" character and information about the particle follows. Particles are structured as follows, using this one as an example:

-   `p` - Says "this is a particle"
-   `10000` - [Material](/Material.md "Material") of the particle. See below for an explanation on what the number means.
-   `0` - The group index for a given particle. This is used by [Rigid](/Rigid.md "Rigid") to determine which particles comprise a given rigid body, and is utilized for texturing Elastic, String, and Wall.
-   `ff` - An unimplemented "layers" feature. This value was meant to be the layer that the particle was located in, but the feature was scrapped.
-   `9999ffff` - The color of the particle - each pair of numbers/letters is R, G, B, and A respectively.
-   `65.555` - X position.
-   `26.0352` - Y position.
-   `-0.0136349` - X velocity.
-   `-0.000272369` - Y velocity.
-   `143` - X position the particle was created at (?)
-   `25.75` - Y position the particle was created at (?) These two may be used by [Rigid](/Rigid.md "Rigid") to determine where particles should be positioned relative to each other, since the shape of a rigid body never changes after it is created and merging two rigid bodies via the 3rd parameter causes them to snap to their original relative positions. It may also be used to align textures to particles correctly.
-   `0` - Angle of the particle.
-   `0` - Rotational velocity of the particle.
-   `0` - The "pressure" of the particle. Used when static pressure is enabled (see [parameters](/parameters.md "parameters")). Increases with the amount of force being exerted on a particle, such as by weight of other particles.

  
==== Recipe codes in Save Files ====
While recipes are usually represented as strings of letters (i.e. ABC) to make them easy to input into the game, they are stored in a completely different way in the save files. Each element is assigned a numerical value in the form of a power of 2 ([A-Null](/Null.md "Null") is 1, [Brittle](/Brittle.md "Brittle") is 2, [Cooler](/Cooler.md "Cooler") is 4, [Dense](/Dense.md "Dense") is 8, [Elastic](/Elastic.md "Elastic") is 16, and so on)

The recipe code is the result of combining the numerical value of all constituents and converting it to [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal).

To mix elements, simply add their numbers together - for example Fuel is at position 2 and 10, making it element number 20. So Gas + Fuel = 40 + 20 = material number 60 in the save file. If you wanted to make Gamma Gas it would be Gas (40) + Gamma (10,000,000) = material number 10,000,040 in the save file. This works for simple combinations with only 1-3 elements, owever there is a caveat - the materials are stored as hexadecimal numbers. This means that if you keep adding materials, the numbers don't stop at 10. For example the material Dense + Cold would have the value of 4 + 8 = 12, in decimal. However hexadecimal counts up to 16 using letters - so the material is actually represented as \`B\` in the save file, hexadecimal for 12. Using the "Programmer" mode in a calculator app makes this easier.

### Joints

Under the list of particles is a list of joints between particles, specifically those used by [string](/string.md "string") and [elastic](/elastic.md "elastic").

Here is an example of a joint, in this case between two [string](/string.md "string") particles:

``` text
j 270336 12 13 0.749998 0.250002 0.237167 0.711512 0 0
```

The "j" marks a joint. Joints are structured as follows, using this one as an example:

-   `j` - Says "this is a joint"
-   `270336` - This is the "joint index" and is used to associate particles into a shape. The highest number is currently unknown but it is readily apparent the joint index limit is substantially higher than the rigid group index. It is also in decimal as opposed to hex.
-   `12` - The first particle in the joint. This means the 13th particle in the particle list, because computers count from 0 instead of 1.
-   `13` - The second particle in the joint. An easy method of finding these numbers is to use a line counter in a text editor and subtract the line count by 3.
-   `0.749998` - anchor distance in Standard Units, seems to only be used by String
-   `0.250002` - the distance from the anchor the particle will try to maintain. Seems to only be used by String. Setting to 0 makes the joint much stiffer but a little glitchy.
-   `0.237167` - X axis anchor distance, relative to the particle polarization. Seems to only be used by Elastic
-   `0.711512` - Y axis anchor distance, relative to particle polarization. Seems to only be used by Elastic
-   `0` - rotation of the joint, responsible for Elastic stiffness and the Spin-Charge effect
-   `0` - possibly how much pressure the joint is under, this last one is essentially untested

  
===Parameters===
Near the bottom of the file is a list of [parameters](/parameters.md "parameters") affecting various aspects of the game.

Here is an example of a parameter:

``` text
@ surfaceTensionCoefficient 0.1
```

Parameters are designated by the "@" character. Parameters are structured as follows, using this one as an example:

-   `@` - Says "this is a parameter"
-   `surfaceTensionCoefficient` - The name of the parameter.
-   `0.1` - The value of the parameter. All parameters are numerical. True or false flags are stored as 1 or 0.

  
=== Textures ===
At the end of the file is a list of textures. Textures have the following format:

    texture 3 neko_a.tiff 32.375 31.625 48.375 47.625

-   texture - denotes that this is a texture
-   3 - this is the associated group index. Materials compatible with texturing are Rigid, Wall, Elastic, and String.
-   neko_a.tiff - filenames can be absolute or relative. Filenames cannot contain spaces or likely certain symbols but exactly which characterset has not been investigated
-   numbers - yet to be determined
-   

## Editing

The .oec file can be opened and edited in any text editor.

  

### Uses

.oec editing can be used to [copy and paste](/Copy%20and%20Paste.md "Copy and Paste") groups of particles, which is not possible within the engine itself. This is especially useful for creating many copies of small [objects](/Object.md "Object").

It's also possible to [link particles](/Linking%20particles.md "Linking particles") easily by setting the rigid body ID of two separate rigid bodies to be the same.

[Spin-Charged Elastic](/Spin-Charged%20Elastic.md "Spin-Charged Elastic") is caused by extremely high rotation values. In the save file, these values can be changed. You could do it manually, but [Robert's Comb](/Robert%27s%20Comb.md "Robert's Comb") is much more effective. You can run the rule `(p 10 .+) \S+ \S+ \S+ \n` and replace with `$1 0 0 0 \n` on the entire file to "comb" the elastic and return it to normal.

It's possible to create recipes without using the in-game mix mode by editing the recipe code. On Windows, you can use the calculator app in "programmer" mode to help you. Open the calculator, click on the three lines and select "programmer" mode. Then, select "hex" and pick the binary editor. You'll see a bunch of 0's. The one marked 0 is the first one, which corresponds to [A-Null](/Null.md "Null"). The second corresponds with [Brittle](/Brittle.md "Brittle"), and so on.

If you wanted to create the recipe PAY in the programmer calculator, you would flip the bits corresponding to the letters' positions in the alphabet minus one. Ticking 15 for P, 0 for A, and 24 for Y will get you PAY. You can also do the reverse, entering the code into the calculator and looking at the result in binary.

Because the recipe code is 32-bit, you can also use this method to more easily create recipes containing the [extraneous nulls](/Extraneous%20Nulls.md "Extraneous Nulls").

  

## Breaking the game

Through editing the .oec file, it's easy to break the game - intentionally or not.

(Future editors, list ways the game can be broken by changing values to something other than what the game expects)

Common errors that will break a save mostly revolve around not following the formatting EXACTLY - a notable example being that \*every particle\* has a single SPACE after it's final number that isn't obvious. If you paste particles and DON'T include this trailing space character, it will break the save. If you add an extra space by accident, broken save. Extra newline after the final particle? Broken save. Forget to hit 'enter' to paste the new particles on a new line? Now there are two particles on one line way up in the save, broken. Accidentally fat finger press another key while pasting? Now there's a single extra letter hiding somewhere, broken save.

See the [.oec File Manipulation](/.oec%20File%20Manipulation.md ".oec File Manipulation") page for instructions on how to repair/diagnose a broken save.

Editing [parameters](/parameters.md "parameters") is a whole beast in and of itself. Read the article to see more.

  

### Infinite Velocity Bug

It's possible to corrupt a .oec file without editing it by giving a particle infinite velocity. One way to achieve this is with [anti-viscous](/Viscous.md "Viscous"). Attempting to open these files will result in the file only being partially read, so many particles will be deleted, joints will be broken, and all parameters will be reset back to default.
