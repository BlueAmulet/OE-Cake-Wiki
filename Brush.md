Brush is a tool in OE-Cake that lets you draw lines of a certain width.

The Brush tool can also be used to create circles of any size, by clicking and moving very slowly until it activates the tool.

You can adjust the size by changing *lineWidth*in the [Parameters](http://oecake.wikia.com/wiki/Parameters).

Brush draws particles on a grid, which creates a rough surface. This is in contrast to [Pencil](/Pencil.md "Pencil").
