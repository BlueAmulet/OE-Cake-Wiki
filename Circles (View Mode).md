**Circles** is a View Mode in OE-Cake that is much larger and more detailed than either points or crosses. It allows relatively high frame rates even in complex situations, while still allowing you to see what's actually going on!

**Blurred Circles** is the same as Circles except it blurs high-speed movement, giving slightly more 'realism'. This blur can be harnessed by [Blurstreaming](/Blurstreaming.md "Blurstreaming") to produce more detailed simulations.
