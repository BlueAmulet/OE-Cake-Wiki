![Splash.png](/images/Splash.png "Splash.png")**Splash** and **Bubble** are tools in OE-cake that change the appearance of [water](/water.md "water") when its moving. Splash adds a "foam" above the surface any water that splashes with enough force, and Bubble adds a bubble wherever water flows enough.

Splash is occasionally glitched where a single Splash particle will fail to dissolve away and just keep getting larger and larger.

Bubble is useful for seeing the flow of water easily, because Bubbles seem to follow individual particles. Deleting Water with bubbles in it will leave the bubbles permanently behind.
