**scale** is the [Parameter](/Parameters.md "Parameters") that controls how large of a [Canvas](/Canvas.md "Canvas") you have to work on. Scale does not affect physics, so everything will behave as expected. *Scale* can be used as a way to "zoom" in on particles. First you must pause so that your creation does not get pushed over the edge if you move the screen, then you can change *scale* so that you can see better and work easier, then you must change scale back to the previous value, re-center your creation if you moved it, and unpause in order to not damage anything.

On OSX enabling the Parameter *scrollFlag* allows the *bounds* parameters which represent the in-game size of the canvas, to be separate from the *viewWidth* and *Height* parameters which represent the size of the window in the operating system. Sadly it seems as if this functionality does not work in Windows.
