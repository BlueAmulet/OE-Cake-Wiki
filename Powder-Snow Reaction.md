The **Powder-Snow Reaction** is caused by the material PY or PNY, when the *standardDistance* [Parameter](/Parameters.md "Parameters") is changed to a number less than 0.563. This is because the density of Powder is determined by *standardDistance,*and [Snow](/Snow.md "Snow") seems to provide an attractive force. As the particles get smaller they seem to have less friction, and eventually they start moving on their own. The unusual behavior can be explained by [quantum mechanics](/Quantum%20Physics.md "Quantum Physics"). The PY reaction may be the most aesthetically pleasing candidate for simulating a [time crystal](/Time%20Crystal.md "Time Crystal").

Snow on it's own is a complex material but combined with Powder the most complex material in the game, some highly unusual things happen.

AY is a liquid, but PAY is a solid

NY is a solid, but PNY can be a liquid

The material PAY resembles a crystal, almost like ice. It has a repeating structure of particles. The material PNY is a crystal when standardDistance is larger than about 0.55, but turns into plasma below that number. Try it out: fill your screen with PNY, save the file somewhere , open it with a text editor, scroll to the bottom, change <em>standardDistance</em> to 0.5, save, and open it. The PNY will turn into plasma. ![Time crystal, anyone?\|centre\|frame](/images/Isotope%200.563 "Time crystal, anyone?|centre|frame")
