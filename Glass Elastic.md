**Glass Elastic** is a special state of Elastic created by setting *elasticCoefficient* to 0.9 in the [Parameters](/Parameters.md). It is much stiffer than the default Elastic material, and resists being moved quickly. It deforms locally rather than spreading force by bouncing away, the pattern indicates how it will behave.
