**Snow** is a hidden element that is not on the elements pane. Solid snow by default is the material YQ. Contact with Hot for the first time will cause Snow to be removed, melting into water, but this "snow-water" cannot be frozen back into snow. There is no way to get Snow from other elements, it must be selected with Y.

Contact with [Water](/Water.md "Water") will cause Snow to begin to melt. The initial Water may come from touching Hot. The "melting" process removes the Snow element but leaves behind the Water, which melts more Snow furthering the melting process until all the Snow is liquid. The element [Null](/Null.md "Null") is useful because it does not cause Snow to melt.

Melting pure [Elemental](/Materials.md "Materials") Snow produces Null. Mixing [Powder](/Powder.md "Powder") and Snow and changing *standardDistance* produces the [Powder-Snow reaction](/Powder-Snow%20Reaction.md "Powder-Snow Reaction").

### Alternate Snow Physics

<img src="/images/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-08%20at%203.58.35%20PM.png" title="fig:A-type Snow on the left, N-type Snow on the right" width="220" height="220" alt="A-type Snow on the left, N-type Snow on the right" />
There are two types of Snow, which I have called A-type Snow (paint) and N-Type Snow (fluff) due to it's relation to the [Null](/Null.md "Null") element. The default Snow is N-type and has the usual behavior. A-type Snow flows like water but leaves behind a sticky surface coating, almost like paint.

Making alt-snow is actually easy. The material AY is alt-snow, the material Y or NY is default Snow.

It is currently not known why A-type Snow and N-Type Snow have different behaviors. I believe it's because A-type Snow thinks it is supposed to be Water, but retains it's stickiness.

Paint does not stick to itself but does stick to other particles. Combining AY in a recipe would make a material that doesn't stick to certain objects also containing AY.
