![The 3 basic classes of Baker particles](/images/Bbp.jpg "fig:The 3 basic classes of Baker particles")**Baker-Bertrand particles** are emitted by compound materials containing Rigid, Tensile, Fuel, Heater and Gas (the Gas is not required in zero-gravity).

The material begins to fracture, breaking into smaller pieces with less spin, and a greater linear speed. The particles also seem to randomly change direction, or stop completely due to [Fire Decay](/Fire%20Decay.md "Fire Decay") and/or [Ghostface Killah Deflection](/Ghostface%20Killah%20Deflection.md "Ghostface Killah Deflection").
The very last pieces emitted from a block of this material are the fastest moving, but they have no spin. On the contrary, the first particles spin rapidly, but with little to no linear movement.

The existence of the Baker-Bertrand material is due to an apparent glitch in the material TR. Try it yourself, use the Brush tool to create many small pieces of Tensile+Rigid. They will stick together almost magnetically, and without gravity they will start to spin. The smaller the particle the faster it spins.

## Behaviour

The strange behaviour of Baker-Bertrand Particles can be attributed to these effects.

-   [Fire](/Fire.md "Fire") Decay (Breaking apart of Fire)
-   [Tensile](/Tensile.md "Tensile") adhesiveness
-   [Tensile-Rigid reaction](/Tensile-Rigid%20reaction.md "Tensile-Rigid reaction") (spin)
-   [Ghostface Killah Deflection](/Ghostface%20Killah%20Deflection.md "Ghostface Killah Deflection") (random deflections)
-   [Rotational energy/Linear Energy conversion](/Rotational%20energyLinear%20Energy%20conversion.md "Rotational energy/Linear Energy conversion") (tangental/centrifugal force)

## Classes

![Chart of all 9 particle classes. Red dots indicate regular Baker-Bertrand Particles, and blue dots indicate Special Baker particles](/images/gba2.jpg "fig:Chart of all 9 particle classes. Red dots indicate regular Baker-Bertrand Particles, and blue dots indicate Special Baker particles")
There are three normal classes of Baker-Bertrand particles, and then rarer [Special Baker particles](/Special%20Baker%20particles.md "Special Baker particles") (the first part of the class denotes rotational speed, the second part denotes linear speed, with α being the lowest value, γ the highest):

-   γ-α - Gamma-alpha (High spin, low linear speed) These are the particles that are made first.
-   β-β - Beta-beta (Mid spin, mid linear speed) As γ-α particles decay, these smaller particles are made
-   α-γ - Alpha-gamma (Low spin, high linear speed) As β-β particles decay, they launch α-γ particles at high speeds. These are the smallest particles, and are made of only 1 point,

These classes of metaparticle are caused by the default settings. By altering various [Parameters](/Parameters.md "Parameters") it is possible to manipulate the various forces that constrain particle behavior and affect the stable states.

By measuring the spin rates of individual particles it may be possible to calculate whether particle spin has quantifiable energy separate from the particle's mass. Since many [Elements](/Material.md "Material") do not change their behavior when the particles are rotating, it is difficult to determine if particle spin is just a visual effect or if it actually has a minuscule but measurable behavior.
