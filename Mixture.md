*Not to be confused with [Mix Mode](/Mix%20Mode.md "Mix Mode").*

A **mixture** is a **compound material** made up of two or more distinct substances. They differ from [Recipes](/Recipes.md "Recipes") in that their components are separated into distinct particles, instead of having all properties shared by a single particle. This allows more complex behaviors to emerge.

## Types of mixtures

### Heterogeneous mixture

A heterogeneous mixture is a mixture in which the constituent substances are not distributed evenly. Heterogeneous mixtures often form when the substances being mixed have different physical properties or are solids.

=== Homogeneous mixture ===
A homogeneous mixture is a mixture in which the constituent substances are distributed evenly.

## Behaviors

Hybrid materials created by the suspension of one material within another can have unusual and useful behaviors. For example Tensile which is agitated in an atmosphere of Gas naturally forms bubbles, much like soap.
