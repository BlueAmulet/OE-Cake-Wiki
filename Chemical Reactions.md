OE-Cake has some reactions that vaguely resemble those of molecules, atoms, and nuclear forces.

### Chemistry

If you place liquid Jet in a lightly pressurized Water environment, it will often form droplets, resembling oil and water. This could provide a protected zone from which different reactions could occur.

Single Tensile particles will "orbit" a non-Tensile particle with zero friction, resembling electrons orbiting a nucleus.

Certain combinations of Mochi, Powder, Snow, Viscous, Tensile, and Water can be used to produce long-chain molecules and repeating structures.

### Atomic Reactions

Single particles can have elastic and inelastic interactions.

Powder with *powderExtinguishCoefficient* set to 0 slightly resembles the motion of atoms in a liquid of a certain temperature based on *powderExplosionCoefficient*.

Powder and Snow can create repeating crystal-like structures, which can exhibit a variety of crystal-like defects. When subjected to varying levels of pressure, these crystal structurers will transition along several organizations of varying density.

### Nuclear Forces

Tensile molecules can be thrown together at high speed to combine and split in unique ways.
