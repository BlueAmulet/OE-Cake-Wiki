The **Gage Reaction** is a phenomenon exhibited by [supercritical fluids](/Supercriticality.md "Supercriticality"). It is related to the [Sonic Boom](/Sonic%20Boom.md "Sonic Boom") reaction.

## Explanation

At the critical pressure, [thermal noise](/Temperature.md "Temperature") caused by Brownian motion causes particle positions to vary by up to 1 particle length. When particles can oscillate by such a wide margin, their "nucleus" may become extremely close for a single frame, generating a proportional but unrealistic level of force, catapulting them apart. This adds a large amount of energy to both particles, which then go on to hit and overlap more particles. In a cascading reaction, particles begin aggressively [teleporting](/Teleportation.md "Teleportation") onto each other, creating an extreme repulsive force concentrated in the high pressure zone.
