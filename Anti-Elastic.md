**Anti-Elastic** is a special material that has the property of repelling particles instead of attracting them. Anti Elastic is formed by setting *elasticCoefficient* in the [Parameters](/Parameters.md "Parameters") to a negative number.

It behaves similarly to normal Elastic in that it produces a springy effect, but is suitable for compressive springs instead of tension springs. In theory it may be possible to use Anti Elastic to simulate nuclear forces between particles, by balancing the negative Elastic force with a positive String tension metastable configurations of freely floating particles may be created.

Using [Blurstreaming](/Blurstreaming.md "Blurstreaming") makes it easy to see how negative particles balance force. The outside of the canvas is a no-slip boundary so the particles are held in position purely through a semistable state of repulsion. Based on the particle distribution we can see it takes a very large amount of particles pushing out of the corners to support a handful of particles across the spans.
